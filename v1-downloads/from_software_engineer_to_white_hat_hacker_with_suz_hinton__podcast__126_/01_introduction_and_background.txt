this is my 20th year in the industry um you know it would be sadly it would be a bit strange if I didn&amp;#39;t have a little bit a burnout at this point right [Music] welcome back to the Freo Camp podcast I&amp;#39;m Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we&amp;#39;re bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we&amp;#39;re joined by Suz Hinton she&amp;#39;s a software engineer security researcher and she was one of the pioneers of live coding on Twitch Su how&amp;#39;s everything going with you well it&amp;#39;s going great thanks um I&amp;#39;m really excited to be on this podcast given that we&amp;#39;ve known each other for a while so yeah and this is like the first time we&amp;#39;ve actually had like a synchronous conversation I think we may have been on some podcasts together like guests on like JS party or some of these other podcast but I don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;ve ever actually talked to you in real time back and forth like this no it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s always been like email or again yeah it was with the gaggle of other people so yeah yeah well was so cool uh I am hyped to learn about you uh I&amp;#39;m going to be taking notes furiously as we go through this and uh I&amp;#39;ve already done a lot of research like rereading your awesome article that&amp;#39;s on free C Camp about your live stream live coding setup and uh I&amp;#39;m going to be linking that and other cool things that Su mentions in the show notes but yeah let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get into it uh I always like to start with just giving people perspective and understanding your kind of origin story as a developer because you have like a really interesting twisting and turning whining path through Tech because you were in Tech very early and then you just went and basically did like every single sub area of tech over the years it seems like yeah we and and the other thing to note is I know I&amp;#39;ve been talking most of this podcast so if you heard some of what Sue said she does have a little bit of a non-north American accent she hails from Down Under yeah so you&amp;#39;re based in Melbourne yeah that&amp;#39;s right Melbourne Australia which is southeast kind of like on the way to Antarctica so so you can kind of stop over that&amp;#39;s usually how I try and describe it yeah apparently yeah yeah and I had the pleasure of visiting Melbourne uh a few years ago for a conference and it was just I love that City my goodness I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;ll ever go again just because it was a huge plane trip to get over there from California I mean like it was like a the longest flight I&amp;#39;ve ever taken was to Melbourne I think yeah but uh yeah like what was it like growing up in Australia and like what were your early Ambitions as a kid I loved going up here I think I was definitely somebody who felt very lucky very very lucky and we we used to sort of affectionately refer to our country as The Lucky Country just because we knew if you were born here that you already had a really good Head Start in life um wasn&amp;#39;t a very ambitious person you know like I you know even just growing up I didn&amp;#39;t have huge travel aspirations or anything so it is funny in the end that I ended up living in um in the United States for about 12 years um but yeah I just loved growing up here this city has gotten the world&amp;#39;s most livable city award like years and years and years in a row um it&amp;#39;s just it is actually an objectively good City even though I&amp;#39;m very biased because I was born and raised here but yeah um there&amp;#39;s a reason why I&amp;#39;m living back here again right and I haven&amp;#39;t chosen elsewhere so yeah well what did you like what were your early interests because I know like whenever I talk like you&amp;#39;re like the third Australian I&amp;#39;ve interviewed for like the re recent recent history on the podcast and uh it sounds like like a lot of the technology that that we had in the states uh like a lot of like early Apple Computers uh Commodore 64 Amiga uh a lot of those computer like did you grow up did were you lucky enough to like have a computer in your home what type of gear were you working with yeah that&amp;#39;s a great question so um I know that a lot of that stuff originated in America but it does kind of find its way to the I guess like secondary and tertiary markets so um my family growing up didn&amp;#39;t have like a ton of money uh we I was very fortunate to to grow up middle class but it&amp;#39;s not like we could afford to buy like the brand new computers um all the time and it was sort of hard to justify buying one back then um because it was you know the late 80s early 90s it was really only a few are very geeky about computers um this was pre- Windows and all of that so I was lucky enough to inherit a Commodore 64 from my uncle and mind you this was still this was the early &amp;#39;90s so we were starting to move into Windows 3.1 um but I didn&amp;#39;t care that it was behind I didn&amp;#39;t even know that it was a computer that was behind um but given that there&amp;#39;s no sort of goey there&amp;#39;s all you do is type into a prompt you know I I turned to my dad and said how do you you use this it looks cool but I don&amp;#39;t know how to use it and so he showed me a few prompts uh he taught me a tiny bit of basic and then he just kind of left the the the computer manuals with me um and I just got really hooked straight away so I think that I was was lucky in that I did inherit an older computer because I had to sort of learn computers like the hard way um and so even when we moved into things like Windows 3.1 95 98 things like that I was still trying to code you know um regardless because I found that that was quite interesting yeah and was there anything that pushed you in like a creative Direction like were were there some applications that you were using that like really uh it what point did you start saying I want to learn more computers learn more computers more about computers and I want this to be like a thing that I do when I grow up did was that like in your mind at all yeah the last part was not in my mind at all I just thought it was a fun hobby like again I&amp;#39;m not very ambitious and so I just I was just like I like this computer so I&amp;#39;m going to keep playing with it but I think what really brought things home for me was once you once batch files were a thing in Windows and you can start automating things um that&amp;#39;s when I got really excited because you know you can set things up so as soon as you log in to your account you can run a batch file and that batch file will you know pop up all the different programs that on games or like Windows Media Player or something and I just thought that was so cool that you could you know just script something like that um and then once I actually started getting onto the internet um I would catch the bus to my local library because we didn&amp;#39;t have the internet at home um I just thought websites were so cool and I figured out that you can actually make them you know I found a book in the library for kids called your own website um I actually ended up finding a copy um years later for nostalgic reasons but I looked at it and I was like oh you just type stuff in notepad this is actually like way easier than I thought it would be and so I think my big moment was really learning how to use computers to do things for you so it was like the batch files but it was also making websites was just such a creative thing as a kid and then putting it on the internet being able to tell your friends they can go look at it at home as well you know there&amp;#39;s something very magical about that experience especially back then when not a lot of your friends actually had websites or or you know were interested in that yeah yeah I mean you got to be like the first kid on the Block so to speak or one of the first kids in your class to to have their own web presence if you will yeah it was exciting it was like the late &amp;#39;90s and I just thought it was the coolest thing ever yeah yeah so like uh at what point did you start thinking about like School Beyond High School yeah I originally wanted to be a veter nurse um but I kind of just lost interest like I I really like animals but then I realized that it was going to be maybe a bit of a depressing job I think that unless you go on to become a full uh veterinarian you kind of don&amp;#39;t have the nice jobs as vet nurse um so I sort of went back to the drawing board and I didn&amp;#39;t really think of computers for the longest time until probably the last year of high school and I had never heard of computer science um I didn&amp;#39;t hear of it until years and years later and so I&amp;#39;m just you know looking in the you had this big reference book back then uh in Australia of all of the different university courses you could take and so it was a physical book that you you you sort of like palmed through and I just kind of started looking up information technology and applying to random um universities that way but none of those courses were anything that I actually wanted to do so to be honest I was pretty lost and I didn&amp;#39;t know if I could even get a job you know it was still just a hobby for me at that stage so I sort of locked out in the end I think yeah what did you end up doing like in terms of studies yeah so I got into like an
