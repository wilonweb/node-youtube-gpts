lab yeah are there so what&amp;#39;s the most ambitious Hardware project you&amp;#39;ve worked on um this is going to sound unexpected but I it was actually when I was working for Microsoft um I was trying to I was working with like a medical medical equipment company for the hollow lens okay I guess that&amp;#39;s mic the yeah yeah so I would say that that&amp;#39;s embedded because it was like an actual kind of wearable device right and we were trying to um basically set up like the beginnings of what sort of live streamed 3D virtual experiences right so let&amp;#39;s say we had something so the hollow lens is not like the um some of the other virtual reality headsets um although it&amp;#39;s mixed reality everything all the processing was on the actual device so you didn&amp;#39;t connect it to a computer like the Oculus or whatever right so it couldn&amp;#39;t you know it didn&amp;#39;t have as much power as something like an Oculus Rift uh and so if if something if we had to do like 3D manipulations or something like that that were like really really processor intensive we couldn&amp;#39;t do it on the device so we were trying to figure out a way to um use like streaming technology um and I think we were trying to do it over RTC I think um and directex we were trying to figure out how to actually like have this very sort of zero latency you know like the sensors in the hollow lands would would transmit over that RTC channel the data Channel over to the server then the server would use directex to render the actual 3D view based on how you moved your head and then like whip it back to the machine to render as quickly as possible and so I thought that was probably one of the more challenging things that I&amp;#39;ve worked on because I had to like learn a I mean I&amp;#39;d never worked with RTC before um and I just had to just really think about how to optimize things as much as possible and just the concept of realtime streaming was sort of new back then you know I don&amp;#39;t think stadia was was a thing and I don&amp;#39;t think Amazon&amp;#39;s version of game streaming was a thing so for us we were like is it even actually possible like are we going to achieve the latency we want without making people feel motion sick right with that sort of slight delay so I thought that was actually a really interesting project that I worked on yeah what was the result were you able to figure out a way to do it in a way that didn&amp;#39;t make people emotion sick yeah so we were able to finish the Prototype and the job that I was in at the time that&amp;#39;s all we kind of got to do yeah we&amp;#39;re like here&amp;#39;s the Prototype we&amp;#39;ve validated it and then you just kind of move on so I&amp;#39;m not sure what actually happened to that given that it&amp;#39;s proprietary and sort of like not sort of public so yeah yeah you&amp;#39;ve worked at a lot of big tech companies and I will get back to live coding but like since you mentioned you&amp;#39;re work at Microsoft you worked at like [Music] was like a funny thing that her sister had done she&amp;#39; worked at like all the different fan companies but uh what was your time as zos like yeah not a lot of people ask about that so I appreciate that um it was my first job in the US and I was moving to Las Vegas so like there weren&amp;#39;t really a lot of places to apply for jobs there and I was just like I someone told me about Zappos because they&amp;#39;re just being bought by Amazon they&amp;#39;re not a thing in Australia you don&amp;#39;t like order from zappos.com or anything and they&amp;#39;re just like oh it&amp;#39;s sort of a bit cooky there it&amp;#39;s quite creative you know I think that it fits your personality you should totally apply and it was a total moonshot um but I managed to get a job there and I was there for almost 4 years and it was wild um probably one of the most formative jobs that I&amp;#39;ve had in my career just because of the timing of it and when it was good it was really good um a lot of the Amazon stuff started some of that culture started seeping in towards the end which was why I left but the first 2 or 3 years were again just really formative very influential on me the front end team there at the time was world class I mean like world class um you know they cared a lot about performance which is something that I&amp;#39;d never really had to um worry about in my career to a degree like I worked for mostly advertising Consulting so you just created a website for your client and then you handed it off and you never saw it again you know and they were very simple websites they weren&amp;#39;t super JavaScript heavy maybe some Google Maps and that was about it um and so I hadn&amp;#39;t really written a lot of JavaScript either so I wouldn&amp;#39;t know the first thing about performance and so I learned so many things in that job and the front-end team were just so talented and so nice um and so inspiring and so I think that was when I went from just stumbling through my career to oh I actually want to be on this level I want to be at this caliber and it really sort of P me to improve a lot so um even just outside of the really cool culture of Zap where it&amp;#39;s very creative or the meeting rooms really zany and you know the CEO uh at the time was was quite a character I just found it really inspiring because of the front-end team like they&amp;#39;ve really brought me up to the next level of skills yeah so it what was it like moving to the states I mean a huge proportion of the people listening to this podcast are from overseas and a lot of them would love to come and work for one of the big frankly like high-paying US tech companies because uh Americans may take this for granted that like tech jobs just pay a a lot of money uh often like a lot more than you know working in accounting or working in other not like non software engineering fields of engineering for example um but like moving to the US from Australia like there are lots of cultural differences even though you got the same language and everything like had you been to the US before you came to uh apply this was your first trip to the US really no um I&amp;#39;d been to I&amp;#39;ve been overseas once I went to venatu which is just an an island off the you know a few hours from the coast of uh Northeastern Australia no I&amp;#39;d never been to America um my partner scored a job in Nevada and so it was more just like we were going for his job but I quickly discovered that you can&amp;#39;t just move to America like you sort of have to have a Visa and that usually means you have to have a job um and so that was the reason why I moved overseas um but yeah the I actually took a pay cut um because at the time like Nevada was really low cost of living and the front end engineers at zapo weren&amp;#39;t valued in the same way they they were seen as less technical than the backend Engineers so we got paid a lot less than some of the other Engineers of the company they then corrected that a few years later but I took a pay cut actually to go work in America which I know is not the usual path but after that obviously like my the the jobs I got after that and especially at some of the larger tech companies obviously I started earning a lot more money there so it was a wild experience to go from you know being on a salary that I was relatively comfortable with but had to sort of budget carefully and things like that right and couldn&amp;#39;t live outside my means to then being on salaries that were just almost uncomfortable for me me you know because I just thought it was so much money um really wild experience very challenging to get through the first set of immigration paperwork as well I wasn&amp;#39;t prepared for that and that was quite stressful so for anyone who has that in mind that&amp;#39;s something to expect how long
