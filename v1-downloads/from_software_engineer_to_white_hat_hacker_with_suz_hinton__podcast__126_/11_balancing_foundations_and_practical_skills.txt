really tough thing for anybody to manage including myself I don&amp;#39;t have a great answer for it um I think for me what I find really enjoyable when you go deep on something is when you&amp;#39;re not having to be constantly distracted by having to look things up or feeling like you&amp;#39;re hitting a brick wall because you&amp;#39;re just missing some foundations on something it&amp;#39;s not enjoyable to go deep if you know that you&amp;#39;re missing certain foundations especially like right around that particular topic area so I think the motivation for me a lot of the time now is to zoom back even though it feels awful to rip yourself out of that you know Rabbit Hole you&amp;#39;re in it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the excitement of knowing that okay I&amp;#39;m going to fill in these foundations I&amp;#39;m going to find something super interesting while filling that in anyway so it&amp;#39;s still going to be an enjoyable process and then when I actually go deep it&amp;#39;s going to be so much more productive you&amp;#39;re going to have this lovely intuition you&amp;#39;re going to have those deep flow moments you know you&amp;#39;re going to be playing the synth music and just like churning something out I think it&amp;#39;s just you&amp;#39;ve got to find a motivation to enjoy those deep Dives way more because you&amp;#39;re not feeling imposter syndrome and you&amp;#39;re not just feeling like I&amp;#39;m never going to get this you know the foundations have just opened up so much in my programming world where I I can just like flip-flop around and and just kind of dive in and out of different things now and I&amp;#39;m just not feeling like it&amp;#39;s this awful kind of stumble in the dark um and so there are times when I still find it hard not to just go deep on something um but I think it&amp;#39;s worth putting in the effort because things just feel way more effortless later on and it&amp;#39;s really hard to give people this advice because it&amp;#39;s one of those things where you don&amp;#39;t get it until you actually do it um and so yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really difficult for me to really give that advice just because you you don&amp;#39;t know until you actually feel that uh and feel that reward of it sorry yeah when you were streaming for several years basically articulating your thoughts and like making them palatable you know as a teacher kind of like taking your thought process and Orting it uh uh verbalizing it do you think that that helped you um code better do you think or do you think like would you encourage people to like kind of think out loud while they&amp;#39;re coding do you do you ever do that anymore is that like a habit like do you talk to
