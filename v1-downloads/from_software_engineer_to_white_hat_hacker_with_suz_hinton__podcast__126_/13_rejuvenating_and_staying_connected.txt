wound mhm yeah I think I&amp;#39;ve just been a would trying to find Joy um so that when I start feeling better like I&amp;#39;m still engaged with the things I enjoy I haven&amp;#39;t taken a total break from everything if that makes sense so I&amp;#39;m reading a lot reading way more um and I&amp;#39;m reading about things like Computer History um and just other things you know like um watching a lot of video game documentaries on how video games are put together like just and and watching a lot of creators on YouTube do what they love so just watching other people who aren&amp;#39;t burned out or who I don&amp;#39;t think are burnt out really engaging with the things they enjoy so that I can get that reminder of why I you know why I love being a software engineer or why I love doing embedded stuff or or why you know I have these hobbies that I have that I just don&amp;#39;t feel like I can engage with at the moment so just trying to stay connected um but also trying to do low energy things like that right like reading a book or watching a documentary is is quite low energy it&amp;#39;s forgiving yourself for not being productive but it&amp;#39;s just keeping you connected all the same to the communities that you feel inspired by I think that&amp;#39;s been the biggest thing I&amp;#39;ve been able to do so that I&amp;#39;m not just sitting around feeling sorry for myself if that makes sense or feeling guilty for it you know yeah yeah I mean that sounds great like I&amp;#39;ll you know share that like I watch lots of documentaries on YouTube uh I I read a lot uh I go for long walks with podcasts and I attribute I guess my longevity which isn&amp;#39;t as long as yours 20 like I I&amp;#39;ve been doing free cocing for like 10 years almost uh so I&amp;#39;m very much trying to Pace myself because I&amp;#39;ve had so many friends who&amp;#39;ve just hit a brick wall with burnout and uh but I&amp;#39;m it sounds like you&amp;#39;re doing everything you need to do to recover so we&amp;#39;re pulling for you to be like back to full power eventually whenever that is uh but um yeah thank I really appreciate you sharing that because in Tech we have this like kind of Mythos around like productivity and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an American thing right America&amp;#39;s obsessed with productivity uh and you know uh I don&amp;#39;t know if that was like a cultural shock when you went to the US where everybody&amp;#39;s like so focused on work and career defines who they are so much yeah I mean was there a moment huge uh it was really hot actually was there a moment where you were like a dinner party and like people asked you what you did and like like where you realize wow this is different from like where I&amp;#39;m from like people don&amp;#39;t you know immediately the difference was was immediate um and just yeah just seeing seeing people really struggle to even like leave a job because they felt like their identity was in it or like people who try to build empires in jobs because that&amp;#39;s like their identity it&amp;#39;s just people&amp;#39;s identity being so deeply embedded in not just like what they do for a living but also that specific company and the team or like the the project that they&amp;#39;re on like people putting their identity into the specific project and them feeling bad if they&amp;#39;re working on something that&amp;#39;s not as exciting as their their as their other colleague is is you know working on something way cooler that really really shocked me I feel very very um grateful that that&amp;#39;s not something that I&amp;#39;ve ever really had a problem with like I can see that and see it&amp;#39;s unhealthy and I&amp;#39;m not interested and um it&amp;#39;s just been it&amp;#39;s just been a a huge contrast and and I don&amp;#39;t think that I just don&amp;#39;t think that I could ever really do that and again that&amp;#39;s probably privileged to a degree but I just I turn off I want to do the best job I can within reason and then I want to be a really great teammate to work with but I just don&amp;#39;t want to put any identity in it beyond that if that makes sense yeah but it it really threw me when I first moved there and some people did actually judge me for that they thought that I wasn&amp;#39;t being a team player and things like that and but I would say that what I was doing was completely reasonable I wasn&amp;#39;t slacking off or anything like that uh I was just being realistic yeah you weren&amp;#39;t letting my opinion so you weren&amp;#39;t letting work completely take over your life like a lot of people allow that to happen exactly like like your employer will let will take as much of your time energy as they can they&amp;#39;ll put you on that fancy you know Google bus and and have you writing code while you commute instead of you know uh like like as much of your time and energy they&amp;#39;ll serve dinner really late at night so you&amp;#39;ll stay for the free meal so you&amp;#39;ll work a little later right like all those little tricks that they do to get you uh or or they call the company a family instead of just being you know a team right um a lot of those things that are like I don&amp;#39;t know if they do it I mean I think they do that in places like China and Japan and stuff like other countries that have unhealthy work cultures but uh but I&amp;#39;m hardened to hear that it it isn&amp;#39;t like that in Australia right like not not to the extent it is in the US not to the extent it can be I think that I think that we all fall into the Trap I think that no country is really like completely immune it&amp;#39;s just not to the same degree for sure so I definitely feel that I fit more into the C the working culture here um people are working a lot right now just because cost of living and and working is very stressful but it&amp;#39;s just not the same identity entrenchment here um and yeah people do want to go home to their families and stuff like that so yeah well I don&amp;#39;t us like I want to end on a positive note and not just on on like U you know American work culture and my beef with it and and you know burnout and things like that since you&amp;#39;ve been reading a lot of books we don&amp;#39;t usually do recommendations since you&amp;#39;ve been reading a lot of books and you watch a lot of video game documentaries what are some recommends that you have for people who&amp;#39;ve listened this far into the podcast are there any channels that you just like love watching to fire you up yeah so um one of the main channels that I love so much is nerd Forge nerd Forge um I&amp;#39;ll yeah I&amp;#39;ll list all of these they just do really creative stuff I&amp;#39;m so into them I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out what the documentary one I watch I think it&amp;#39;s called cut clip cut clip but I&amp;#39;m trying to remember the name of the channel I&amp;#39;m just scrolling through YouTube right now trying to find it for you while you&amp;#39;re while you&amp;#39;re scrolling for it I&amp;#39;m going to throw in one of my recommendations this channel is so great they do like Retro Gaming documentaries and they do like the best kind of like nostalgic 3D graphics and stuff it&amp;#39;s called uh it&amp;#39;s called splashwave and so they&amp;#39;ll cover like how Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog was made you know talk about Michael Jackson&amp;#39;s involvement in the development of the music and that he was like a huge fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and he actually approached him because he wanted to make that&amp;#39;s cool uh or um they&amp;#39;ll talk about uh you know the history of like different like Sega games different arcade games they&amp;#39;ll talk about like the architecture that made certain arcade games possible and they they model all this stuff so a lot of the shots are like effect shots and stuff it&amp;#39;s so cool and it&amp;#39;s got like that that kind of like you know synth retrowave type uh sound going on so um yeah what are some other channels you recommend yeah so the the channel is no clip no clip um that&amp;#39;s the Video Game documentary Channel yeah they are fantastic um and as far as books go right now I am absolutely loving the dream machine it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s such a good book um it&amp;#39;s very dense and very long but I just it is it is the best narrative about just how Computing came to be um it&amp;#39;s just an absolutely delightful read I&amp;#39;ve been really inspired by that so that&amp;#39;s the main one that I&amp;#39;m reading at the moment but before that I read um space Rogue I think space Rogue that one is about you know the um original Cult of the dead cow um hacking group they&amp;#39;re really really cool and so space Rogue was one of the um pseudonyms of the one of the members of the group I believe very cool yeah I remember believe I&amp;#39;m blanking on all of this stuff I remember the cult of the dead cow back in like the the BBS days and stuff we would they are so cool yeah yeah very cool dream machine space Rogue nerd Forge no clip I will second that I love the no clip Hades development uh series it&amp;#39;s like four hours worth of like how they made the game Hades I think it is called Hades right like it&amp;#39;s like a kind of isometric perspective where you&amp;#39;re like zipping around and fighting like all these Greek gods and stuff it&amp;#39;s cool um so Su I just want to thank you again for like 20 years in the field and you&amp;#39;re still sharing your wisdom and uh I&amp;#39;m very excited to talk with you offline about like you know software development education that&amp;#39;s
