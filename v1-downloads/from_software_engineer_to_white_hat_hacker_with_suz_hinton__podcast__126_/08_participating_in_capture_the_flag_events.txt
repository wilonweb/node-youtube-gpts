video on demand it&amp;#39;s like it and I went there and I was just like I really wanted to watch your old streams in preparation for this but I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know if any of those were preserved anywhere is it just lost time or do you have like some hard drive with all the they&amp;#39;re all on the hard drive um so I was very diligent about backing them up and things like that so they&amp;#39;re not lost of time they&amp;#39;re just not online so yeah yeah well um what was it like like the you did it for a few years I think uh like do you remember how regularly you were like how it progressed um just what the experience was like cuz live coding is seeing kind of a Resurgence like I was just talking with the primagen like last week and uh he he&amp;#39;s a YouTube or he he records on Twitch and then he takes it chops it up and has an editor that puts it onto YouTube and he&amp;#39;s very um I think deliberate about how he approaches it but um you know the way that you were doing it was it when I when I watched it back in the day it felt very very different vibe it was much more chill uh much less like social commentary it was much much more just like a a love of The Craft and just like focusing on the code I didn&amp;#39;t it didn&amp;#39;t seem like there were nearly as many memes or inside jokes or anything it just seemed very wholesome is that how you remember it yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how I remember it I think it was different days back then but also I think I had different motivations but I don&amp;#39;t want to speak for the other streamers so I W elaborate on that I just think that I came in with it with those different motivations I only did it once a week which is not something that twitch really likes to do they want you to do it more often but I just knew that that was sustainable 2 hours every Sunday morning was when I did it um and I usually so for the first few I would just pick a feature I wanted to implement in a open in an open source library then after that I was like I need to make this even more sustainable for myself and enjoyable and so that I don&amp;#39;t have to spend hours grinding before you know to figure out what I want to do I would just literally like roll out of bed put clothes on put a put a little bit of makeup on and then show up and say all right let&amp;#39;s look through the issues and maybe the night before if I was particularly drawing a blank on like I don&amp;#39;t even know what I&amp;#39;d work on I&amp;#39;d go through the issues and you know on one of my repos and and sort of think okay has someone opened a poor request sometimes someone would actually open a PO request the night before and I could tell they would hoping I&amp;#39;d review it on the stream so you know I tried to sort of look for something to prioritize um you know as far as that went so it was a very different vibe um we did have only a couple of inside jokes but they weren&amp;#39;t sort of we would always explain them and you know we they were very subtle anyway um and so it was just it was supposed to be cozy time it wasn&amp;#39;t my intention I never really designed My Stream in to be a certain way I just wanted to show up be myself not be a character get some work done you know that kind of thing so yeah and it was practical in the sense that you were actually working on real stuff that you&amp;#39;d be interested in working on like even if you weren&amp;#39;t streaming uh open source yeah yeah pretty much what role has open source played in your career and in your life a lot yeah I actually feel really bad because I when I so I streamed for 5 years and then I decided to just sort of step away um from it for a lot of different reasons um you know none of them were like really negative reasons or anything and I stopped working on open source too it&amp;#39;s like I didn&amp;#39;t have that sort of reason to get up and do it on the weekend so I feel bad I have stepped away from that a bit it is something I want to get back into this year um but it&amp;#39;s had a huge impact on my life um in a lot of different ways and it&amp;#39;s again it wasn&amp;#39;t something that I designed I did open source because I saw other people around me doing it and I thought it was a really cool just Concept in general right and I thought it was again it was just a a very admirable um thing to do and I wanted to be sort of part of that and contribute you know my perspective on embedded software and things like that and and you know it&amp;#39;s a really lovely way to meet a community um and hopefully Inspire other people too and so but through that you know I accidentally got introduced to all sorts of employment opportunities and even the live coding you know I had a couple of years in in developer relations as a result of that because people saw my stuff and reached out and wanted to hire me and so there was a lot of unintentional benefits to it a lot of amazing privileges that I don&amp;#39;t think I would have foreseen that I know that some people we&amp;#39;re getting into streaming now they do it with the aim of achieving those things because they can see that it&amp;#39;s possible but it was very surprising to me how much the stuff I was just doing for myself ended up sort of being noticed by other people and and and opened a lot of doors for me that I didn&amp;#39;t necessarily um you know plan for which is awesome but it&amp;#39;s been mostly jobs and just meeting new people and being able to speak at conferences and all sorts of stuff yeah well I want to talk a little bit about like more recently since you stepped away from live coding uh you know recently you&amp;#39;ve gone and you&amp;#39;ve got like a whole lot of different CompTIA certifications you went back and you got like a proper like four-year degree from Western Governor&amp;#39;s University where Bo K&amp;#39;s studied where several people who&amp;#39;ve been on the free cocam podcast got their undergrad in uh computer science uh maybe you can talk about like the back to school back like hitting the books again because you had like this pretty you were really high up in your career and from the outside from my perspective it sounds like you&amp;#39;re like hey I want to climb down this ladder and I want to go climb up this ladder like this perched against a different bookshelf almost that that&amp;#39;s kind of how I view it is that an accurate representation what was going through your mind you didn&amp;#39;t want to like just stay in this one field okay sort of um I think that I see school in a different way to most people do I know that school is or school I guess college or university I know that it&amp;#39;s very heavily um focused on like workplace career finding a job things like that um but I love learning and I love having a structured learning environment and because I had such an amazing experience with that tap course I just it just really engaged me um I still wanted to actually go and get a full degree so that is what&amp;#39;s called an advanced diploma here um in interactive media that&amp;#39;s what I technically have but it&amp;#39;s not the same like I always felt like I missed out because I just like didn&amp;#39;t end up going to college and getting an actual degree I just felt that that is a an experience for me that I would just really cherish and enjoy and and it had nothing to do with a career or anything like that it&amp;#39;s just it felt like such a luxury Indulgence almost to be able to go to a place that is catering for you to learn things there are experts there that you can talk to to and it is a structured environment so that you understand what you you don&amp;#39;t have to figure out what you don&amp;#39;t know because a lot of the time you don&amp;#39;t know what you don&amp;#39;t know right and so someone is giving you that syllabus and saying here are the things that we think it&amp;#39;s important for you to know and again that just felt like this huge Indulgence to be able to do and so I&amp;#39;ve been dreaming about going back to college for years and years and years and so cyber security was something I was really interested in but felt very intimidated by how broad and how huge and how deep it can go so I wanted to have that sort of expertise to sort of lead me and and give me the foundations I guess yeah what did you do like like describe kind of your path into cyber security from a more you know jack of all trades software developer type background yeah I think cyber security just kept coming up again and again and again um I think obviously it&amp;#39;s become like a huge problem right like we&amp;#39;ve actually seen sort of the um the growth of things like ransomware and scammers and you know whing that even in the age of of you know generative AI now that&amp;#39;s another tool that scamers are using it just kept popping up again and again and again and every time it popped up for me I just got like really excited um because I just thought it was really really fascinating and so you know I did OS training at uh zapo which I now know is a privilege that most workplace don&amp;#39;t give their software Engineers they just expect you to know but when I started it was mandatory that I did an OAS training that was held on site at zapo and that was my first introduction actually to just hacking and threat actors and uh how you can manipulate websites to you know to gain things and that just blew the top off the lid off my brain you know and I was like this is just ridiculously cool I&amp;#39;ve never thought about software in this adversarial way and I was just obsessed um and so you know for years after that I just kept sort of reading different books you know I&amp;#39;d read like uh books such as cuckoo&amp;#39;s egg which is an amazing sort of you know dramatized reenactment of um of you know something that happened at Berkeley um in California it was so cool and then stuck net I read about stuck net and I was like oh my God that&amp;#39;s so cool um and so I just it just kept coming up as a reoccurring theme and with embedded iot stuff you know that iot devices are riddled with software um security issues and so it just kept popping up again and again and again in my career and and I&amp;#39;m interested in it enough on a personal level that I decided to go to school right just to actually finally learn what I could about it yeah and you also earned some certifications which I think is worth noting because a lot of people out there listening to this may be thinking about getting like some like the Security Plus or network Plus or some of I think they&amp;#39;re all CompTIA certifications there may be some additional certifications from other vendors can you just like quickly rattle off some of the certifications you&amp;#39;ve earned over the past few years and what you learned from them what they involve for people that might be interested in getting them so just a disclaimer um all of those certifications were requirements for my bachelor degree in cyber security so WGU like puts a big sort of heavy um focus on getting indust certifications um which you know a lot of Industry actually recommends that students get that&amp;#39;s what they desire in new grads especially cyber security new grads so I got um A+ I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to get my comper A+ actually and I I was so emotional when I finally got it um so A+ Network plus Security Plus um cyber analyst plus pentester plus um I got the um there were a bunch of other ones that I I ass squ um I think like secure it&amp;#39;s basically the is ISC squ equivalent of Security Plus I feel so bad cuz now I can&amp;#39;t remember them off the top of my head I also got project plus which is a project management one which was I actually found really interesting uh a lot of people hated that one but I thought it was useful because project management is useful in any kind of capacity right whether you&amp;#39;re planning to move cities whether you&amp;#39;re like you know writing software right so I found that really helpful so yeah just a whole bunch of them there were more I&amp;#39;ve just forgotten them so yeah and yeah the experience was really good what was the experience like like you just studied did you actually have to report to a physical testing center and like take a test with like some somebody standing over you to make sure you didn&amp;#39;t cheat for one of them I had to um and that was the ISC squ one because they do like a palm vein scan to make sure that you are the identity you&amp;#39;re saying w you are and I got sort of searched and I had to put my glasses on a tray and that to spin the glasses around to make sure that they weren&amp;#39;t augmented glasses it was really intense but the the rest of them I actually did Via online proctoring and that&amp;#39;s because I was doing that bachelor degree during the pandemic so CompTIA had actually pivoted to allowing people to test from home um so I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s still an option but it definitely was during the pandemic where they would install basically spyware software on your computer which sucked um and then you had to quit everything you had to show the Proctor that you weren&amp;#39;t running any like cheating software or anything and then you would do your exam on the computer at home so I was lucky that I didn&amp;#39;t have to find a testing center for most of them because I think that just adds extra stress yeah and uh
