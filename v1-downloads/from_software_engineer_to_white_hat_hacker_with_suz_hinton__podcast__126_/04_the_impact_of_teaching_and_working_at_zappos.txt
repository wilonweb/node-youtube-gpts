equivalent in t yes uh yeah like did teaching did that like fire you up did you enjoy teaching yeah I did actually I really enjoyed it um I&amp;#39;m not sure why I just really liked you I mean you you&amp;#39;re the perfect person to talk to about this um you know you know when you get that you see that light bulb go off on in someone and you know you see them actually like really enjoy what they&amp;#39;re learning and they feel like oh I can actually do this too and it&amp;#39;s the same as like any hobby like I think any hobby that you do most people are very very happy to teach somebody else because just bringing them in and and sharing that Joy with someone is really really great so that was something that I think was what motivated me um to teach I wanted to spread the same joy that I felt when I sat down at the Commodore 64 for the first time um and I rewrote the curriculum mostly just because uh when we did our web design 3 semester uh it was using a Microsoft access database and cold fusion and that was sort of starting to become uh just old Legacy kind of software and so I thought this isn&amp;#39;t Preparing People for the workplace very well so I rewrote it in PHP and basically the um we did the wamp stack in the end so the windows uh Apache uh MySQL and um PHP stuck so I just rewrote the whole curriculum to do that and instead of creating um I forget what we actually made in that c fusion class but I said okay everyone&amp;#39;s going to make a Blog and then you can use that also as your portfolio if you want when you graduate um because back then you had to actually show portfolios to get web jobs you weren&amp;#39;t doing like leak code or hacker ranker or anything like that right um and so I just rewrote it to make it more useful for them when they graduated and I just thought that cold fusion and access was just not going to be the way going forward so that was the main reason why I rote it I just thought it would be more engaging that way yeah well I I do want to get to live coding uh before we get to live coding though um I mean again I&amp;#39;m trying to like piece together the chronology of your career in real time but uh but like teaching and live coding have got to be pretty related like those skills that you got helping light bu go off in people&amp;#39;s heads like face to face and now you&amp;#39;re jumping on Twitch and you&amp;#39;re basically just coding live right there and like them and like showing people everything you&amp;#39;re doing and explaining what you&amp;#39;re doing and talking out loud thinking out loud and interacting with chat and stuff maybe you can talk about the process of getting into live coding what inspired you to first start doing it yeah for sure I mean I got inspired by the people that were doing it really early on so um Casey from hand handmade hero um he I think was one of the very very first to do it um but I think what gave me the boot up the bum so to speak to to actually try it myself was I had a friend who was doing um he was doing open source and he just I think he just did YouTube live or something like that I forget what he did but he just um I just don&amp;#39;t want to put him on blast so I&amp;#39;m just giving him some privacy by not calling out who they are but um he just did some open source he&amp;#39;s like hi you know I work on I&amp;#39;m helping to maintain pouch DB I&amp;#39;m just like you know I just need to do some open source work I just want you to show I just want to show people like what is it like to actually maintain open source cuz I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of sort of misconceptions at the time know I think this was back in 2015 2014 there were just a lot of misconceptions about open source and contributing to it and you know a lot of people sort of put open source maintainers on a big platform and found them intimidating so he&amp;#39;s just like oh just you know just sit and watch what I do for an hour and watch me flipping through issues and closing them out or replying to them and he was also just showing that there&amp;#39;s a lot of drudgery in it it&amp;#39;s not just like heroic coding and pushing up pull requests you know there&amp;#39;s also just a lot of staring at something and figuring out if it is a bug or not or like answering somebody you know back and forth in an issue so I just thought that was really interesting I really appreciated it at the time because all of the open source stuff I did was so small and it was only me and so seeing someone maintain something big that everyone sort of had to collaborate on I thought was really interesting so I remember putting a comment on his YouTube video saying this is actually really cool maybe I could do the same for my embedded Hardware libraries because people are scared of those kinds of projects and maybe I can show people that it&amp;#39;s really not a big deal it&amp;#39;s just still JavaScript at the end of the day that you&amp;#39;re writing so that was the kind of origin story of why I started I was literally like hey I found this useful maybe I&amp;#39;ll do my own version of it that sort of sheds some of the intimidation factor for like a slightly different angle you know yeah and we didn&amp;#39;t really even get into like your love of embedded development but like you&amp;#39;ve been very vocal about that um over the years like being really into like building things like physical Hardware like like uh you know I think you you had like the Ada of fruit like you know chip set of the month thing or something the box that they was in you that was so cool the monthly boxes yeah that was so cool yeah it fruit is like the raspberry pie company right like they they they ship out raspberry pies no that&amp;#39;s element 14 but they do do they do make their own stuff yeah so they make their own boards and um things like that yeah ad fruit are amazing thing they based out of New York so and and you&amp;#39;ve got like quite a bit like I mean you&amp;#39;re kind of blocking it in the frame for people who are watching the video they can see you got like a a detailed workbench like a pegboard is that like a some sort of like uh you know CNC machine or something or a 3D printer what is that big thing behind you the big boxy thing yeah yeah so that&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a 3D printer laser cutter and CNC machine in one um yeah it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s very big it&amp;#39;s very heavy I had to actually um so I I bought that as an Ikea table you know with the legs and everything but I had to then go and buy a new tabletop like basically a huge slab of uh plywood from the hardware store and paint it just to be able to support the weight of it which is quite funny but yeah so um I am really interested in that I&amp;#39;ve always been interested in that and that&amp;#39;s because of it again a teacher in my T course one day brought in an arcade cabinet that he built from scratch um and it was amazing it was like the sit down coffee table one and coil he showed us how yeah is that what they called a cocktail that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re called in the states like cocktail model it&amp;#39;s like basically like Pac-Man or something where you got one controller on each side and the screen kind of flips depending on that&amp;#39;s exactly what it was yeah yes yeah it was really cool um so he made one of those and he just asked people if they were interested to come in on a Saturday so we all came in on a Saturday and he just grabbed it out of the back of his car and he took the whole thing apart and showed us how it works and back then there was no Arduino so what you did was you took the circuit boards out of keyboards old recycled keyboards computer keyboards and then you just like kind of um hacked them and solded your own sort of uh wires to different you know parts of the keyboard Matrix and you use that to you know solder your joystick buttons and and things like that to the actual um yeah to the actual arcade machine and so you know he was showing us how to do all of this and he&amp;#39;s like here&amp;#39;s how to avoid all the ghosting problems on your keyboard because back then there were ghosting issues what is ghosting exactly I just thought that was the yeah so ghosting used to be a thing on um old school keyboards like the PS2 connected keyboards where because like keyboards are sort of like on a on a circuit Matrix if you pushed certain key combinations too fast you&amp;#39;d either get the wrong keystroke or you wouldn&amp;#39;t the keystroke wouldn&amp;#39;t register I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly just cuz I haven&amp;#39;t needed this knowledge for a long time but it was called ghosting where you&amp;#39;d either get the wrong key press or you&amp;#39;d get like another different random letter because of um certain letters having certain uh or certain Keys having certain relationships in the electronic circuit um where it would just cause issues so um I guess cross wires so to speak so it was really interesting so he would he would show us how to kind of pick the different letters on the keyboard to avoid the ghosting issues when people were playing a video game cuz obviously that would be very frustrating so sorry that was a really long story but that was sort of how I got involved in it and I remember I started like I started collecting all these old keyboards I was that person that was like yes and then I&amp;#39;m going to make something with them these you know and then a few years later the Arduino came out and I was like oh this this is what we needed this whole time so then I went and did an Arduino course in Sydney um and the rest was kind of History I think this was 2006 2007 I did that and then I just started playing with embedded stuff like in my spare time for for basically every year since yeah and so like even today you still will like bust out like gear and just start Hardware hacking yeah so I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time these days just cuz I went back to UNI which we&amp;#39;ll talk about later but um I still like make stuff like I&amp;#39;m just going to grab something don&amp;#39;t judge me cuz I&amp;#39;m wearing my slippers cuz it&amp;#39;s cold no worries and I&amp;#39;m going to verbally describe so she&amp;#39;s got a big room she&amp;#39;s walking across it uh she&amp;#39;s got again this beautiful white workbench uh with like perfectly spaced and like like very deliberately planned out like where you&amp;#39;re going to put your drill and where you&amp;#39;re going to put all your different you know screwdrivers and stuff it&amp;#39;s a really cool looking U backdrop uh so she&amp;#39;s back in her chair cuz a lot of people like half the people watch yeah sorry sorry sorry I didn&amp;#39;t me interrupt you no no go on I was just going to say cuz like about half the people that listen to like maybe a little more than half of the people will just listen to the audio Edition like I just listen to the audio Edition um I don&amp;#39;t usually watch the video but for those of people who are watching the video Edition yes we do have a video Edition on YouTube you can go there and you can see what su&amp;#39;s background is or if you&amp;#39;ve got like a a phot if you want to just snap a quick photo of it I can just throw it up in the show notes and people can like link directly to the photo um yeah she&amp;#39;s given me the thumbs up so it sounds like we&amp;#39;re going to have a cool workspace photo we might if you take a good one like and we can get it into a square we could even potentially put you at your desk on the Instagram because Freo Camp does have an Instagram it&amp;#39;s about you know I don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;ve got maybe like several hundred images of people in their work workbenches and stuff so proud of it um but yes what&amp;#39; you grab show us yeah so I&amp;#39;m really lucky to have that space behind me by the way um so I&amp;#39;ll just describe it again for the audio people this is something that I made years and years ago but I actually got it out recently just to repair it because it broke when you know one of my moves that I did um so it&amp;#39;s supposed to be like a a a um one to one size replica of the metro card from New York City subway so it&amp;#39;s like a train ticket and so the actual silk screen on the um circuit board is supposed to look exactly like it you&amp;#39;ve got the magnetic strip here which is Sil silk screened in like a big white strip um and so it&amp;#39;s got like a little greeting card sticker that sorry speaker that you can take just out of one of those musical greeting cards um and it has like a little um 3D printed sort of like gramophone style sort of you know that horn shape yeah so it&amp;#39;s just supposed to play Train noises that&amp;#39;s literally all it does um but it it sort of shows the different skills that come together right and why have a 3D printer just so you can do that um and you know the soldering iron behind me you know I use that to actually repair it so the speaker actually broke off um and the wire snapped as well so I resolder that together glued this back down with a little bit of super glue and then it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good to go again so so that&amp;#39;s just an example little things like that will it work right now yeah I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ll be able to hear it cuz it&amp;#39;s very soft CU it&amp;#39;s not an amplified speaker okay the cling doors please that&amp;#39;s pretty cool yeah that that came through fine I think so it just does the you know stand clear of the closing doors and that was a noise that I heard every day in New York City when I lived there so it makes me very nostalgic yeah yeah and I love it like on the note of geeking out about mass transit I love mass transit whenever I go to a new city I love to like just take their train system around of course I live in a city that doesn&amp;#39;t even have a train system unfortunately well technically we do it&amp;#39;s just like I I&amp;#39;ve never used it before cuz it only goes in like to certain parts of town that I&amp;#39;ve never even been to basically like you can take it to get to like the the fairgrounds basically where they have this the Texas state fair with the giant cowboy guy Big Tex but that&amp;#39;s it and I&amp;#39;ve never got an opportunity to write it anyway sorry for the the you know tangent about mass transit but yeah like so you&amp;#39;re building things uh you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re F you&amp;#39;re feeling inspiration and you&amp;#39;re just like you have the skills and you have the gear to be able to like 3D print things or use subtractive you know um technology like CNC to get metal into a certain shape that you need it um so you you have your own kind of Hardware lab that you can go into and get things done with yeah that&amp;#39;s what I call it behind me the
