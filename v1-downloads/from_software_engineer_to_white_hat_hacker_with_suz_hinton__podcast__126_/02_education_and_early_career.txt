information technology degree but it was going to be like a I think a 2 to 3 hour um public transport ride there and back so you know like 4 to 6 hours round trip every day I just figured out that that just wasn&amp;#39;t feasible I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to move out yet so um my mom actually saw like an advertisement in the local newspaper for a um I guess the equivalent in America is community college but here it&amp;#39;s called ta which is tertiary and further education so it&amp;#39;s more of a trade school um she found like an advertisement for like um multimedia it was a multimedia course it&amp;#39;s now been renamed to interactive media and it just looked like everything I&amp;#39;ve ever wanted to do in one right it was like sound production and 3D modeling and um video and making interactive games and making websites and things like that so um just got just just kind of just a spur of the- moment thing we went down to the school and applied and it was past the deadline and everything but they actually let me in based on the websites I&amp;#39;d been making as a kid you know um so honestly it was just very serendipitous because that course that sort of twoe um associate of Arts sort of put me on a good pathway for me realizing that this might be a thing that I can do professionally yeah and what kind of uh skills did you walk out of that program with and like I don&amp;#39;t want to gloss over the entire program because we&amp;#39;ve got so much to talk about but like while you&amp;#39;re answering that question just like any other like interesting kind of discoveries you had about yourself or about technology during those two years uh getting your Associates yeah I think what I found was that as long as it was creative like it was as long as it was a you know using the computer in a creative sense I would just really latch on and get very engaged um with learning but the course was not really learning any programming there was a little bit of scripting and Flash but it was mostly just doing everything else but programming um which sort of gives you this huge grab bag of skills that I&amp;#39;ve been able to reach into over and over again over my career and also in my personal life as well you know especially the the sound production the video creation you know because we&amp;#39;ll talk about that later but even just the 3D modeling you know that came in way more useful in my life than I thought it ever would um and so it was just good to learn a bunch of different things that I didn&amp;#39;t even know was sort of you know a a path of expertise just to get a sample of everything so I sort of came out of that course as a very sort of well-rounded creative technologist I guess you could say yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense um and it sounds almost kind of like the equivalent of like going to like video game design school or something like that is yeah yeah there was actually a video game track that they opened up later on and I was really annoyed because they they released that like a year into my course and I was like oh do I switch to that one that seems so cool yeah well I mean you&amp;#39;ve described your uh your education as a quote unquote jack of all trades um and uh you know could you talk about why this process was like a big asset just having like such a grab bag of skills uh and like what your first jobs like what they were after you finished this program mhm yeah I think it definitely set me up for um my first couple of jobs I was just sort of taking contract work for a little bit and when you take contract work you know sometimes they will just ask if you um you know if you can do this or do that and they sort of try and sort of use as many skills as they can um and so it meant that I could just jump from contract to contract and not worry about the fact that I was like very Junior um because I could just sort of like use that jack of all trades to problem solve in in a lot of different cases and so for example you know one of my first jobs I was making Flash banners for like a major car company and just making cars Zoom around you know on and I was that person that made the annoying ad banners that you saw on the early internet which you know whenever you AR I&amp;#39;m quite ashamed cleaning of the industry yeah I was just thinking like so for people that don&amp;#39;t know uh what sus is talking about like I just had these memories like certainly the early 2000s you you would arrive my kids are like yelling something in incomprehensible about Sour Patch Kids mom&amp;#39;s coming to uh escort them away from the premise all right uh so what I was saying is um yeah like I remember you&amp;#39;d like arrive at like IGN or like some video game website and like you&amp;#39;d be like all right I can&amp;#39;t wait to read this article like all this stuff starts popping out like all this animation and and of course your site like your internet connection starts chunking and everything is like super duper slow because this overly ambitious you know thing is like blocking your view of the article you&amp;#39;re trying to read exactly so you were like developing that those kinds of things for like advertising agencies or who who were you working with yeah so that was me that was me making those annoying ads and they were particularly animation heavy back then just to get the people&amp;#39;s attention uh it was the advertising agency Jay Walter Thompson that&amp;#39;s who I worked for early in my career um and so yeah they one day they&amp;#39;d say uh we need you to do these flash banners and then another day that&amp;#39; say oh we have this um InDesign document that we&amp;#39;re making into a PDF but we want you to add sort of some interactive hotspots in it do you know how to do that and then another time you know they&amp;#39;d be asking me to make this full-on sort of immersive video website that where the video sort of Blends in with the web page and it was it was very sort of futuristic back then um and so being being able to be on the video set as we were sort of filming and me having that background really helped me say yes this is something that I&amp;#39;ll be able to blend in and just having all of these different pieces of um even though it was all very surface level obviously like Jack of all trades there was just these really nice instinctive moments where I could come in and and intuitively you know understand how something would be put together and in the advertising agency world that is just so bizarre are just really wild stuff happening all the time um thinking on your feate was very high highly valued at the time I guess yeah so a lot of people who are entering software development like the way I describe the free cocan podcast audience is like onethird developers one-third High School University students and onethird people who are working in other fields that want to get into software development maybe they&amp;#39;re driving trucks maybe they are working as an accountant maybe they are uh just coming out of rehab or coming out of incarceration or any number of different things right maybe they&amp;#39;re just getting out of like uh you know some sort of situation where they were previously like a stay-at-home spouse and now they have to reenter the workforce right so like like there&amp;#39;s a wide variety of people and a lot of those people may have like skills from a past life like they used to work in uh one field or another like as a developer just day-to-day do you find yourself calling on all these kind of random skills that at the time may may have felt like I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m ever actually going to use this in a professional capacity like have you have you found just like random things that you picked up to continue to be useful and helpful for getting things done yeah yes and no I think it greatly depends on what your profession is you know like I think that there&amp;#39;ll be little random things that come in handy and obviously I can&amp;#39;t comment on that because I haven&amp;#39;t done a lot of those different careers but um um just things from time to time so for example you know I&amp;#39;ve never worked at a video game agency um and I&amp;#39;ve never you know had to do anything professional in that capacity but because we played with some of those physics a little bit in tap um I&amp;#39;ve being able to just you know intuitively understand when a certain animation needs to happen on a website when you&amp;#39;re using CSS animations and like the the tweening or the key um you know creating the of just like drawing a blank what are they called the key key key frames no not yeah key frames is that like like when you&amp;#39;re like animating something like you you kind of like yeah put the character in different shapes and then the software interpolates like what the animation is supposed to happen Okay M yeah I don&amp;#39;t know anything about animation I just got lucky and knew that for that term yeah exactly and so that stuff came along for web pages like years and years and years later right like flash was already dead I thought okay I&amp;#39;m never going to use any of those skills over again um and then all of a sudden you know we had things like key frames and CSS and I&amp;#39;m like oh my God you know I can actually use that now or even when 3js came to um the web right um in JavaScript you know I was at a hackathon once and um somebody wanted to create this sort of like 3D lathing system and you know I already had some of the kind of theory on that even just like calculating the frost room and things like that and you know for actually programmatically creating it even though I&amp;#39;d never touched programmatic 3D modeling I had that you know intuitive background where I could figure things out and I sort of had that that that you know reasoning in order to problem solve so it hasn&amp;#39;t come in handy all the time but it sort of surprises me when it does because it does tend to be quite spontaneous like that yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s cool it sounds like this uh broad skill said has been very helpful so from developing uh you know banner ads and and other things that advertising agencies needed like like where did you move from there in terms of like the what was the next step step in your career yeah advertising was definitely not for me like if you&amp;#39;ve seen Mad Men um it&amp;#39;s very much I love Mad Men I love I love that show we talk about it often it&amp;#39;s like my favorite show of all time but I would never want to live in that world that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s funny yeah exactly exactly it is funny that it&amp;#39;s one of your favorite shows but yeah it it was very much like that right like every every agency is its own flavor of that depending on the decade and like you know there&amp;#39;s just different different nuances to it it just wasn&amp;#39;t for me I think I was there for maybe a year a year and a half or something I forget but I just wanted something a bit more quiet um and something that wasn&amp;#39;t advertising it just didn&amp;#39;t sit with me you know I just was like I don&amp;#39;t like making these annoying things that people have to run into on the internet right it just didn&amp;#39;t feel right so um I ended up just pivoting into different roles so I moved into e-learning next um I was actually teaching part-time um the back at the the tap the university that I studied at I went back to teach for 3 years to part-time so I just moved right into education actually so I was sort of I was doing QA and accessibility testing for a bunch of e-learning tools that are used in various ta institutions in Australia and then yeah I would then go in Moonlight as a teacher and so that was nice and then I just worked for a bunch of web shops right like consultancies and stuff before you know working for more SAS um companies later in the last in the sorry in the the second part of my career so far so it was just kind of stumbling around trying to find stuff that you know was was a bit more morally in line with what I wanted to work on yeah so you had problems with like working in the advertising agent agency industry if you will I mean that whole industry is based around like manufacturing desire of products that people don&amp;#39;t necessarily need right getting them to spend money getting people going to De lots of products that are very bad for obviously Mad Men the whole the whole theme going through the entire Series this isn&amp;#39;t a big spoiler because it comes up in the very first episode is cigarettes right like cigarettes are an unnecessary thing that are incredibly damaging to people like they&amp;#39;re damaging to the environment they&amp;#39;re damaging obviously to Public Health like uh a huge portion of my tax dollars that I pay are going to help people who smoked a bunch of cigarettes and are now need all this end of life care that&amp;#39;s caused by that and you know like man like Don Draper the main character himself is like addicted to smoking and he can&amp;#39;t quit and he just kind of like accepts that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of the things I love about madman sorry to go off on a Madman tangent but like it was no I get it inconceivable that you could actually quit and he&amp;#39;s just like really pissed off at the cigarette companies whom he&amp;#39;s been benefiting from his entire career as an Advertiser advertising executive right um he&amp;#39;s just upset like because he realizes like I&amp;#39;m hooked this is going to kill me and I can&amp;#39;t quit like I I&amp;#39;m just going to be addicted to this for the rest of my life he feels like he&amp;#39;s been hoodwinked essentially and it&amp;#39;s like kind of like the it&amp;#39;s like this angry chip on his shoulder throughout the series but um but yeah like I I can totally see like I have lots of friends who are in advertising and not everybody&amp;#39;s advertising something as damaging as cigarettes but I can I can I can still see like maybe you could talk about that like don&amp;#39;t worry about sliding the advertising industry just talk about like how you really feel about the field having worked in it like were there any moments where you really felt you look back and you regret doing certain things that you did yeah it&amp;#39;s good because I I it&amp;#39;s a good question because I did go in very naive right and the that was sort of the job to get back in the day if you um were kind of more on the creative side of software as well um and so it was so exciting you know I was competing with other graduates in my class for that job like we all wanted that job so badly and so to be honest you know I think there are a lot of parallels with that nowadays in certain jobs that seem really cool but might be a bit morally questionable um but that was my first experience with it really opened my eyes I don&amp;#39;t know it was just working in advertising was really cool for a lot of different reasons it was very like fastpaced you know there were times when we were pulling all nighters to um Pitch to to win a certain account you know like there was this big Lottery account that we were trying to win and we made their entire pit into a huge game show in one of the meeting rooms so we converted one of the rooms into a massive game show and everyone had to dress up and you know and so I was being picked up at 4 in the morning to come and work on the interactive PDF because you know that&amp;#39;s when the designers actually finally finished the work went to bed right and then I got the phone call in the middle of the night and that&amp;#39;s like really really bad right that&amp;#39;s a very bad thing and we don&amp;#39;t encourage that but that was sort of the adrenaline rush of working in advertising where sometimes you get a bit Stockholm syndrom in where you you&amp;#39;re all in it together you know and so it&amp;#39;s exciting and we might win the pitch and things like that and you sort of feel like you&amp;#39;re part of something um and so I would say that it was just very mixed I wasn&amp;#39;t always creating annoying crappy things were websites for um Brands as well where you know the the the the actual user had to want to go to the website they had to want to go to kelloggs.com or something and you know visit that website and so we weren&amp;#39;t sort of annoying them in that way and so I would just say it was mixed but after I left I definitely regretted that I added to the advertising on the internet because I think that back then it was pretty simple there wasn&amp;#39;t there was no such thing as tracking pixels and things like that at least when I first started but by the time I moved to the industry and I saw how much more creepy and manipulative advertising was getting that&amp;#39;s when I started feeling embarrassed that I was sort of part of the beginnings of it if that makes sense yeah that totally makes sense because like adte advertising technology like being able like there have been a lot of breakthroughs and trying to successfully get you to part with your money really or or to make some sort of big purchasing decision on behalf of your company or whatever it is uh and the thing that uh it works right like if you go raise a bunch of venture capital and you have this war chest uh you can
