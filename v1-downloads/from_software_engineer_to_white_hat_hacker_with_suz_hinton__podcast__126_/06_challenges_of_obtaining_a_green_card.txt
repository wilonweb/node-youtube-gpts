did you live in the US total 12 years I think yeah did you get did you apply for like a green card or any sort of permanent residency or did you always have the plan to go back to a Australia yeah it sort of flip-flopped a lot when I first moved there it was only going to be for a year and then I thought I&amp;#39;ll stay a few years but I&amp;#39;m definitely going back um and then I kept staying and I&amp;#39;ve been in some long-term romantic relationships over there right so if I was in a long-term relationship at the time I thought oh well this sort of has given me some incentive to actually stay um and so at some point you know I did start working on a Green Card application just to make things a bit easier for myself because it&amp;#39;s really stressful to know that when you lose your job or if you quit you need one immediately or you have to basically Deport yourself um and I found that enormously stressful it was always a big thing in my head I felt like I couldn&amp;#39;t really buy property or do anything permanent there until I had that permanent residency so I did actually spend a number of years trying and failing to get a green card it&amp;#39;s not as easy as it sounds and some people just have a much harder time than other people sometimes it&amp;#39;s just really bad luck but I never really got there so for that entire 12 years I was sort of precariously on a a work visa but I think that&amp;#39;s very normal for people from um countries like India where the Green Card applications are oversaturated in for their quota um so it&amp;#39;s not as if you know that&amp;#39;s a unique experience I know some people that are waiting you know 20 to 30 years for their green card so um I don&amp;#39;t want to trivialize that either but I was in a similar situation where I just felt like I kept running into dead ends or you know the pandemic happened which put a hold on a lot of um Green Card applications I know that right now because of all the layoffs in Tech most companies have to pause their Green Card applications for everyone because the Market&amp;#39;s too saturated with um American citizens so uh because of the process you can&amp;#39;t justify hiring somebody from overseas so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a very fraught process um but I did try uh to get there it just didn&amp;#39;t happen so yeah
