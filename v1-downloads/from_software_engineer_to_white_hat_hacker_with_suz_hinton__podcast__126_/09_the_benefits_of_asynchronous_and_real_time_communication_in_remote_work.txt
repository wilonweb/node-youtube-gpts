so you finish the degree you finish these certifications you&amp;#39;re going back into the job market but this time not as a general software engineer frontend developer like all the different things you were doing before but as an actual security researcher what was that process like and you know what was it like kind of assuming that new role and yeah it was really cool I think that um what gave me a soft Landing was that it was still a software role but I was just moving over to work for a research team um and so I&amp;#39;d be working with data scientists and um actual researchers with phds right in cyber security and things like that um and so it was more sort of a soft move over there and I got noticed because you know I was putting all these certifications on my LinkedIn and I was I was doing a security lead position at stripe at the time too so I was sort of trying to cut my teeth on more security focused roles so I sort of tried to just subtly transition and take on more and more in my current job and that&amp;#39;s sort of what got me noticed um by my boss at crowd strike who actually cold reached out to me um and said would you be interested in you know applying for this specific job in research and it was threat hunting research specifically and so but when I joined um so I ended up applying getting the job and I joined crowdstrike and I can tell you that the bachelor&amp;#39;s degree made my job so much easier even though I was still writing software I understood why I was writing things I knew how to use all the language and the words with the researchers and I could talk to the threat hunters and they&amp;#39;d mention like a hacking tool you know um they&amp;#39;d mention something like blood hound or they&amp;#39;d be talking about Mimi cats or something and like I knew exactly the even just the context of what that you know particular intrusion was that we were looking at um and that my software was trying to surface and so it was huge um it made me feel like I didn&amp;#39;t just do that degree for my own enjoyment it ended up really just making my job much more fulfilling because I didn&amp;#39;t feel intimidated and I I understood everything that was going on so that was a really really lovely transition that I made in my career where everything just lined up really nicely and you know the because I went so deep on all of the you know things in my bachelor degree I didn&amp;#39;t just do things to pass exams I really engaged with things I played with the tools I really studied the certifications not for the certification but to actually learn something from the certification it ended up just being such a huge reward when I actually moved into a position like that yeah so it sounds like you&amp;#39;re pretty happy with the transition like was it all sunshine and rainbows or like is the grass always greener on the other side like like what was it like being an actual security researcher working I mean you were working you say oh I took I cut my teeth on a job at stripe as a security leader uh what was it I mean that sounds like the type of job yeah I was the lead of my team yeah yeah but but like yeah it was it it was really more of a security Champion like you know there were security Champion programs in um different software companies where I was the tech lead of my actual team um of my software team but then everyone like the security team at stripe I did not work for the security team they wanted every team to kind of have a security lead so that were the representative for making sure that we were doing all the right things and that everyone was educated on the team when it comes to like good security practices and things like that just because otherwise they Spread Way Too Thin so that was where I could say I was cutting my teeth on something that was not super high responsibility but gave me an excuse to engage with the security team too and just like use the actively use the knowledge that I was studying in the bachelor&amp;#39;s so that was it was actually one of the best transitions I&amp;#39;ve ever had in my career honestly like it just everything was just so lucky like when I moved over to crowd strike uh they write a lot of their software in go in goang and I learned goang at stripe and so the transition just could not have been nicer um especially given it was a remote job I was the only one in Australia working for that team at crowd strike so I really had to be quite self-sufficient even when I was ramping up because there wasn&amp;#39;t always someone available to help me at the during the time zone um you know non overlaps I guess yeah is is crowd strike an American company sorry I know this is like a super ignorant question I could have just Googled but like uh pretty much every big company you worked at it sounds like has been an American company so you&amp;#39;ve always had to deal with the like I guess since you moved back to Australia you&amp;#39;ve always had to deal with this like substantial time difference I mean it&amp;#39;s incredible time difference like I&amp;#39;m getting ready to put my kids to bed and you&amp;#39;re literally waking up and it&amp;#39;s like 8: a.m. there and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re kind of getting started with your day uh yeah so you had to learn a did you do a lot of this asynchronously do you think that a lot of your experience doing open source and doing communicating through GitHub issues and pquest and stuff was that helpful just having that experience communicating through open source for working remotely at an American company from Australia yeah 100% actually I&amp;#39;ve never drawn that link before that&amp;#39;s very ex um that definitely helped me just being comfortable with asynchronous stuff and going to bed you know having left a message for someone and knowing that when you wake up in the morning they will have responded and just learning to be patient absolutely that was very helpful and um yeah I guess I&amp;#39;ve never thought about it before but that was very um very very similar experience um and you know in in open source sometimes you&amp;#39;re just like well I&amp;#39;d open an issue but what if I just go splunking through the code base maybe I&amp;#39;ll actually be able to find the issue and fix it myself and save everyone some time and then just open a poor request it&amp;#39;s that same kind of thing where sometimes I&amp;#39;d have questions and I&amp;#39;m like screw it you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s um like I would work from 7:00 a.m. my time till 3:00 p.m. uh my time just to get a bit more overlap with people in the states um you know I willingly did those hours but once you got to like noon my time I was like well I&amp;#39;m just going to smun through the source code because there&amp;#39;s no documentation CU we&amp;#39;re a research team you know we just have a lot of ephemeral stuff that we can&amp;#39;t always be documenting so I&amp;#39;ll just jump into the code base so yeah I think it was a very similar approach to that that it was to open source yeah how do you feel about like real-time communication tools like slack and things like that versus you know asynchronous communication like email and I guess ircc is more like slack but like uh systems where you communicate through the system like you open a ticket as opposed to just B you know jumping in and immediately talking to somebody in slack or something like that like do you do you think that what are your thoughts on that synchronous versus asynchronous question yeah I I don&amp;#39;t like asynchronous at all um slack stresses me out but I think that&amp;#39;s the case for just about everybody um I prefer real time at all times honestly um unless you know unless you need time to think so what was really nice was you know like obviously slack and emails and everything and meetings would all fall off at a certain point of my day so I would get a lot of focused time so I think asynchronous communication is really great for that where you don&amp;#39;t [Music] [Music] you know my peers when I was studying cyber security um and so I took part in a lot of Collegiate ones actually so once for students so it&amp;#39;s not as difficult um but also you can kind of Benchmark yourself against your your peers so I did a number of ctfs um which I really enjoyed uh it just gives you a chance to apply your skills and to see kind of where you&amp;#39;re at and what you need to improve at and so yeah CTF stands for capture the flag and it&amp;#39;s really just they&amp;#39;re sort of just hacking challenges um sometimes your job is to defend something or to be um someone who reverse Engineers something so you&amp;#39;re sort of on the the good guys side and then sometimes the um CTF events are about actually being the bad person um and you know being the threat actor and you have to try and hack into something and some are like both they&amp;#39;re a mix you know and so I guess it&amp;#39;s kind of similar to a software hackathon you know where there&amp;#39;s a competition and you have to make an app this is sort of the infosec version of it where you have to apply your skills to either defend or attack something which is just really cool um and so I did code breaker which is put on by the National Security Agency the NSA n like the big bad NSA that everybody&amp;#39;s terrified of yeah the NSA I&amp;#39;m going to guess something really funny for you to yeah okay so Su has gotten up from her chair she&amp;#39;s running back to herbench to pull something off the pegboard so this is a fidget spinner from the NSA and this was what I got from them because I finished in like I was in the top 100 or whatever of their reverse engineering competition so that&amp;#39;s my little um weird souvenir a lime green NSA fidget spinner have you taken it apart to make sure there&amp;#39;s not like a microphone in there no but a lot of people have said that and I think it&amp;#39;s really interesting I remember getting the um envelope in the mail the package in the mail and it just says like from National Security Agency and I think I put it on social media and I said oh well the found me it was nice knowing you all or something like that it&amp;#39;s like every time you get a message from the IRS it&amp;#39;s just like you you see that IRS that iconic you know typ face they use and you&amp;#39;re just like your stomach just goes oh no you know then you open it and it&amp;#39;s just like because I forgot exactly exactly so when it came I had a similar thought I forgot all about that I&amp;#39;d filled out my shipping address and everything and I was like what is oh and then I realized a second later so I definitely had that IRS moment where I was just like I hope this is what I think it is because I have gotten letters like that from the IRS and it&amp;#39;s absolutely terrifying yeah awesome well I want I want to be respectful of your time I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of Rapid Fire questions I&amp;#39;m going to start asking if that&amp;#39;s cool with you Su yes do it so just just to like kind of like uh recap your journey so far are so you you uh you started off with a computer in your house uh Commodore 64 The thankfully it was an older model and that was a that way you got to spend a lot more time in the command line and stuff like that that spurred your creativity you went on to study a great deal of different Technologies in as at a uh gosh what is the acronym T TEF T the uh Community t a f Ty yeah t a f and I I&amp;#39;ve written what that acronym stands for in here uh it stands for somewhere in my notes sorry I&amp;#39;m learning all about Australia um okay so I&amp;#39;m not going to Define that acronym I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;ll put it in the show notes uh but uh basically like community colleges so you went there and from there um you ultimately were able to work at advertising agencies you applied for a job in Las Vegas got to move and to the iconic Campus of uh zaposlite to Silicon Valley that was you know five or six hour drive away totes so you did that totes that&amp;#39;s something only a Australians say like tot&amp;#39;s cool am I am I correct like have you ever okay so if you ever hear an Australian cool oh is it British okay well um I&amp;#39;ve only heard so I didn&amp;#39;t
