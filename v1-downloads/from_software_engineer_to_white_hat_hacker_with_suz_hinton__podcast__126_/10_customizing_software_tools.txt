think we made it up okay yeah well um sorry if I&amp;#39;m uh attributing something to the Australian people that should be attributed to the Brits um okay so what I want to know is uh during your streaming back when you were live coding a lot you had this like very cool like first of all you got like beautiful taste in like mechanical keyboards and everything&amp;#39;s like very elegant and uh like thoughtfully put together and and you know just like your your uh your background there uh with like like everything is very deliberately thought out in terms of your physical space but in terms of the software you use do you put a lot of time into customizing your tooling for when you&amp;#39;re sitting down to write some code I do but then I just leave it like I&amp;#39;m not constantly tweaking it um yeah MP mpj from fun fun function back in the day I think he put it best like he stops himself doing it cuz he knows they&amp;#39;ll just do it forever and it&amp;#39;s just a distraction so um I&amp;#39;ve had the exact same Vim config file for years now years and years and years and years this probably hasn&amp;#39;t changed in 5 years just set something up make it so that it&amp;#39;s tolerable to you and then just let it go like you know that&amp;#39;s sort of been my attitude it&amp;#39;s not for every one but that&amp;#39;s worked really really well for me so yeah it&amp;#39;s just nice color scheme all of that it&amp;#39;s got some of the basic tools that I need um and I don&amp;#39;t try to customize anything to death anymore it&amp;#39;s just frustrating to have to set up automated scripts to get it all back the way you want it when you have a new computer or if you know something happens and it&amp;#39;s just a waste of time yeah so just good enough and then don&amp;#39;t micromanage it anymore sounds like yeah and so you&amp;#39;re yeah just leave it learn yeah if somebody wanted to learn them which is kind of like a a code editor that has a little bit steeper of a learning curve because you have to learn like all the keyboard uh shortcuts you got to learn like the different the three I think it&amp;#39;s three different modes like insertion mode and you know like how would you recommend it like do you think it was worth learning it yes and no honestly I think it&amp;#39;s like one of those huge it depends kind of things um if you do want to learn it you want to go C Turkey um I found it was very frustrating for 2 weeks but I wouldn&amp;#39;t let myself go back to Sublime Text which is what I used to use just get through it um and I would say it&amp;#39;s been really good because I do spend much more time on servers these days just like you know like into shell sessions and stuff like that it is so useful to just pop open vim and start typing but at the same time like Nano is there for people to use too and it&amp;#39;s much easier to use so to be honest I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it because it just depends on what you want to actually get out of something you know um I really enjoy it just because it feels minimal it uses not as not as much process as on my computer sorry not not as much you know resources on my computer but you know at the same time it&amp;#39;s been a net positive for me but I wouldn&amp;#39;t say you know it&amp;#39;s been life-changing I think I&amp;#39;m just such a casual Vim User it&amp;#39;s not like the primagen or um Gary burnhard or other people who you you see they&amp;#39;re just like total Wizards in it I don&amp;#39;t know I just I&amp;#39;m not someone who&amp;#39;s really obsessed about my editor it&amp;#39;s just if it&amp;#39;s good enough it&amp;#39;s good enough so yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s a bit of a nothing Burger answer but I just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth it if you&amp;#39;re already happy with your tool whatever you know well to quote something that you said that I thought was was kind of interesting uh that interesting enough to be written down and quoted on the free cam podcast you said don&amp;#39;t put your identity don&amp;#39;t put your identity into a single tool and it sounds like m yeah it sounds like that&amp;#39;s the the vibe you&amp;#39;re good like if the tool works well enough you know Nano I use Nano all the time when I go on servers uh you can just type Nano and it&amp;#39;s built into like I think every Linux distribution uh and it&amp;#39;s just like a emac like environment emac curiously isn&amp;#39;t default in a lot of like different server versions of Ubuntu and stuff so I can&amp;#39;t use emac when I go in there so I just use Nano which is very similar uh shortcuts and stuff but you know whatever gets the job done really at the end of the day right um and I want to like reconcile the so you have spent a lot of time Shoring up the foundational knowledge of computer science of how networks work uh you know security Concepts uh how computers actually work and it sounds like early on in your career you were working with like really powerful tools that were like highly abstracted away and now as you&amp;#39;ve Advanced your skills you&amp;#39;ve gone like kind of further down the the you know veritable stack of mattresses that the princess is lying on top of to see where the P&amp;#39;s are you know um how do you reconcile the tension between wanting to get things done and also wanting to like further cement your understanding of fundamentals so you can get things done faster in the future yeah I think that&amp;#39;s actually a
