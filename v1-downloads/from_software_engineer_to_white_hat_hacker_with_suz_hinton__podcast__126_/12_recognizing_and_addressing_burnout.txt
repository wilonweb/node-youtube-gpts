yourself while you&amp;#39;re coding or do you think that that slows things slows things down a lot yeah I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going to go out there and just say I think in general whenever I streamed on a Sunday as far as productivity problem solving challenge Factor it was net negative honestly you know I just sometimes it was nice to explain to other people and they they&amp;#39;d sort of give another perspective but a lot of the time because I had a lot of the domain knowledge of the embedded stuff like some people could jump in with like oh well what if you just like did a promise here instead or something like some of the JavaScript kind of side of things I would get some cool ideas from people but overall it was a net negative because I find it so hard to focus while I&amp;#39;m also talking I find it so hard to be kind of on the spot and have people watching me and so it&amp;#39;s not helpful but the the thing that it did help me with was peir programming at work became like just not intimidating at all I&amp;#39;m like let&amp;#39;s just jump into it and I was okay with saying I didn&amp;#39;t know something and it gave me a lot more confidence with like working with other people because if you can live stream in front of a couple hundred people on a Sunday and make mistakes in front of them then you can pretty much just not feel afraid of of of working with any colleague after that in my opinion so it definitely helped with that I would say that that was actually kind of life-changing to be honest um it made my day-to-day work with other people much better cuz I used to feel very intimidated about coding in front of others um but the rest of it was honestly just a net negative yeah well it sounds like uh you did get something out of the process even if like those particular days like it was a lot of fun yeah yeah it was a lot of actual fun like we had heaps of fun I just meant programming wise and actually getting stuff done and things like that it was a bit of a a drag on that so there&amp;#39;s the saying that like if you want to go far go together if you want to go fast go alone or something like that uh yeah I it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more interesting if you reverse it if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together right and so it&amp;#39;s kind of like you had the entire you know hundreds of people like cheering you on yeah s s s and like you&amp;#39;re trying to you know close the pr or whatever right so uh yeah it sounds like the fact that you stuck with it for so long I mean you even I think I heard you built your own streaming platform or you started to build a streaming platform just because you were unsatis what was what&amp;#39;s the story behind the sus Hinton streaming platform yeah I just thought that twitch was crap for software programming streams I&amp;#39;ll just come out and say it&amp;#39;s crap it&amp;#39;s not good for that and also twitch incentivizes you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a company that wants to profit so you know the profit incentives just created bad experiences especially for like programming streamers like I could talk to you about this for an hour so I won&amp;#39;t um and so I just went out and wanted to create my own platform that respected the privacy of my users that didn&amp;#39;t that allowed them to use emotes without having to sign up for a paid subscription you know so we could have her own inside jokes and things um that allowed me to just have all these different features that were useful for programming streams that twitch would never do right um and so there were just a lot of misalign incentives I felt using twitch as a platform uh and I I had enough of a community that I felt that they would be willing to make an account on my website and then actually watch me and and interact with me there and that they&amp;#39;d remember I was streaming there and things like that so I went out and started making that and then the pandemic hit right when I was getting close to releasing it and you know just obviously that just put you know a lot of different things in perspective and I put it down for a bit just because you know the pandemic was a tough thing to get through and by the time I was sort of coming out of that I wanted to stop streaming so it just never got released unfortunately but it was a really cool experience actually programming it yeah maybe it&amp;#39;ll come back one day definitely and if if there&amp;#39;s like an open source alternative that people can just self host a website and stream themselves on it I mean streaming has got to be expensive though in terms of like all the data that is involved and like like only a company like Amazon would have the coffers to be able to do that like economically like I I don&amp;#39;t know how expensive it is to pipe HD video to like 200 people concurrently uh is that something where you think an individual Creator could actually run like a streaming platform like let&amp;#39;s say it was like you know a self-hosted tool and you just threw up your server would would the bandwidth on that be like crazy or How would how would it work yeah that&amp;#39;s a good question I ended up creating like a matrix in Microsoft Excel and I looked at every single streaming option everything from Amazon&amp;#39;s own streaming technology uh to you know uh just like smaller companies that were offering at the time and all of the different features and whether or not they had closed captioning for the live streams whether you had video on demand all that kind of thing so I did actually do all the research and it is possible so I ended up standing up a very beefy machine I got a dedicated server in a data center um wasn&amp;#39;t actually that expensive and then um I ended up H having like several hundred gigs of like bandwidth I think it was up to a terabyte of bandwidth or something like that um per month um and so and then I did a whole bunch of tests like I spun up kubernetes to create all of these like spontaneous you up to 500 connections to see if the box would stand up and if the traffic you know how much traffic that was generating and how much bandwidth and things like that so it&amp;#39;s definitely possible because years ago I was able to prove that as a proof of concept in 2019 and I think the tools have gotten a lot better since then anyway so yeah the answer is yes it&amp;#39;s possible you just have to do the research and be willing to have your own dedicated piece of metal so yeah have you ever heard of cloud flare TV it&amp;#39;s like a 247 at the time but yeah yeah our 247 stream focused on technical topics and uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of like what you&amp;#39;re talking about it&amp;#39;s like a platform but it&amp;#39;s really just cloudfl like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m you can just press play and you can watch people like live streaming their 247 and I think some of it&amp;#39;s probably pre-recorded it doesn&amp;#39;t have chat uh but it is cool like the notion that like like I always fancied like free C Camp could have free C Camp TV and it would just be like an old school broadcast channel from you know the terrestrial you know uh satle like airwave you know like UHF if you ever saw the 1980s movie UHF where with weird inic like we could theoretically do that using tools that cloud fler has published but I still think that like what you&amp;#39;re talking about is is a little bit different because it&amp;#39;s like twitch in a box basically it sounds like yeah yeah I would be very interested if you do pursue that uh at some point or if you decide to get back into that project let me know I would be very interested in following that and uh I&amp;#39;ll certainly try to help encourage people to uh contribute to it so what is on the horizon for Su Hinton what what are the big goals like we&amp;#39;re basically out of the p pmic um you have an entire new skill set that you gain it sounds like you made Incredible use of that time uh what are your plans for the next few years yeah you kind of caught me at a Crossroads so I I I quit that job the research job um couple of months ago it was an amazing job um I just want to take a little bit of time off for myself that&amp;#39;s all that was a very hard decision actually because I loved my team I just need some time off I I am carrying a little bit of burnout and I&amp;#39;m just finishing up my Master&amp;#39;s Degree as well I&amp;#39;m working on my thesis at the moment so it seemed like good timing for me to just focus just on the thesis just spend a little bit of time like recouping um you know just being well enough again and things like that um so yeah like I&amp;#39;m keeping things open ended this year um I will be finished and hopefully graduating by July so that&amp;#39;s actually not that far away it&amp;#39;s May right now so I think 6 to 8 weeks I&amp;#39;ll be finished with the master uh thesis and to be honest I&amp;#39;m trying to keep things open um and so I&amp;#39;ll be doing a little bit of contract work for the rest of the year in software um and I&amp;#39;m looking to maybe start working on some online education courses because I&amp;#39;d love to get back into teaching so yeah just not putting a lot of pressure on myself but just getting around to personal software projects I&amp;#39;ve been putting off for years cuz I&amp;#39;ve been in school you know since the p mic started and and things like that so just you know sort of being able to slow down a bit and just come back to some of the things that are just really important to me um so that I can also just help shed a lot of the burnout of just working in the industry as well cuz this is my 20th year in the industry um you know it would be sadly it would be a bit strange if I didn&amp;#39;t have a little bit of burnout at this point right yeah can you talk about like and I don&amp;#39;t want to put you on the spot uh but can you talk about like how you sensed burnout was setting in like what was there some like moment that you just like damn I think I&amp;#39;m burning out or was it just like a gradual creeping process like be because I mean it seems like you have arrived at that conclusion I&amp;#39;m burning out I need to change I need to take some time off I&amp;#39;m curious for people that are listening to this who may also be closing in on a decade or two decades doing software development like how they can recognize this and know that they need to take time off before things get even worse yeah for sure it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a really important question a lot of it is creeping up um but for me it was like a spike in anxiety every day when you just have to do normal things so if someone hits you up on slack and it&amp;#39;s just totally normal it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re not asking you for anything urgent they just want to talk to you and you just start feeling overwhelmed every time um or just it spikes your anxiety and you just you start withdrawing from people don&amp;#39;t want to talk to them at work even though they&amp;#39;re your teammates you just yeah you find yourself isolating yourself and then on top of that your productivity just takes a huge dive so you know that there&amp;#39;ll be days where there&amp;#39;ll be nothing wrong going in your life but getting out of bed is really hard and then you sit at the computer and you just don&amp;#39;t do any work and you&amp;#39;re just sort of your brain is screaming at you you&amp;#39;re like we have to do something today and it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen you know and then the next day there&amp;#39;s a lot of pressure you feel guilty so you&amp;#39;re able to kind of push through and and do it but it just feels everything just feels like you&amp;#39;re walking through you know trying to get out of quicksand even though you&amp;#39;re getting your job done it just feels so wrong and you&amp;#39;re having to just absolutely force yourself and you&amp;#39;re avoiding talking to anybody and everything just feels like a huge overload on you when it&amp;#39;s just normal day-to-day duties I think that was the first signs for me just total disengagement but you know obviously still trying your best to do your job because you need to make money to survive right um and it just feeling wrong even though you couldn&amp;#39;t find any other reason in your life why you&amp;#39;re struggling to show up every day if that makes sense yeah thank you for sharing that and uh what are some things you&amp;#39;re doing now that you have some time to yourself like how are you kind of decompressing and like rejuvenating yourself uh and uh like I guess tending to that that wound of just burn out I guess that psychic
