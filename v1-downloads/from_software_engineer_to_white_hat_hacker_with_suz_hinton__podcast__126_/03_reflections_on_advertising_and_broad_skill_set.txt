go out and you can pretty much guaranteed get customers through running Google ads or Facebook ads right and uh because there&amp;#39;s just this big audience and you can go through and you can microt Target and you can ab test and you can just kind of use these different processes to arrive at an ad that will convert um were you involved in any of that stuff or did that that come later after you got out of the industry yeah thankfully I wasn&amp;#39;t involved with that um and back then because internet speeds were so slow especially in Australia you know we were required to keep those flash banners really small like I submitted I uploaded one to you know the marketing platform once and I got a this was back in the day you had a phone on your desk too yeah like I would get a call from the guy at the marketing agency totally separate from the advertising agency and he&amp;#39;d be like yeah so your flash Banner was 16 kiloby but we needed to be 15 and so you know we we did have razor thin file size margins back then and that&amp;#39;s quite hard to do when you have like a car asset and the jpeg background for it and a bunch of text and a bunch of key frames and things like that you had to get really creative you know yes yeah you had to get really creative asiz yeah sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to interrupt you by the way like there&amp;#39;s like a big time difference between Texas and Melbourne uh so if it seems like I&amp;#39;m interrupting Sue or if Su is taking a little longer to react like it&amp;#39;s hard to get much farther around the earth than you and I are right now when we&amp;#39;re talking to one another so I just for the sake of the audence I&amp;#39;m wide into the AET yeah yeah me too I&amp;#39;ve got like 500 megabits like super duper fast internet you&amp;#39;ve got super duper fast internet the physical distance the packets need to travel is just so long so sorry anyway uh saying not that fast anyway um yes yeah so you know you really had to creatively optimize that kind of stuff and I felt that that was at least considerate right where you didn&amp;#39;t want to encroach on the user you didn&amp;#39;t want them to have to pay extra for like downloading extra stuffff junk and so back then um as well this was when I was doing this right when Facebook had just launched publicly right and I would say that Facebook has been responsible for a lot of the really creepy and really manipulative advertising right you know and I think that was sort of the dawn of the more sophisticated advertising the same with Google when Gmail came out and they started advertising on you know the AdSense the keywords and things it was right at the dawn of that so thankfully I didn&amp;#39;t get to be part of that you know I&amp;#39;d left and it&amp;#39;s not as if I saw that and thought I&amp;#39;m getting out I don&amp;#39;t like it obviously it took me took us all a few years to really understand what was going on and and for those those really creepy tactics to come out um but yeah I was lucky enough that I sort of don&amp;#39;t really attach myself to that but I just yeah still feel a bit dodgy while the same yeah so where do you go from there like like you&amp;#39;ve got these skills uh but you&amp;#39;re kind of disenchanted with the industry that you&amp;#39;re in so so you said you went back to school uh which is really cool by the way like going to teach I heard that you kind of even helped rewrite some of the curriculum that you yourself learned when you were at uh I&amp;#39;m going to get the the acronym wrong uh the Community College
