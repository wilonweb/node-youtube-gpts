that watch the video so they get to look at like the cool video I put on in the background so that people don&amp;#39;t just have to look at my face for two hours they can look at like a trct mode of some old Japanese arcade game from the 80s okay so back to uh like just day-to-day living as a freelancer so your husband is no stranger at a freelancer life he is doing animation his animation is amazing I don&amp;#39;t know if he also does the sound design but like just like the the candy anything yeah yeah and and like so again I&amp;#39;m going to link to uh that one video about your coding Journey uh which what we just talked about at length over the last hour you can like learn all that in six minutes with really cool Pokemon kind of Earthbound looking uh animations and stuff um by the way I was like watching that video I was like uh I hadn&amp;#39;t seen it in like four years since you first published it and last night I watched it um and I also I showed it to my kids um back in the day but like I I left this really lengthy comment on on YouTube like anybody who leaves comments on YouTube if you ever feel like man YouTube just like did anybody even see my comment I don&amp;#39;t think anybody saw this comment you saw it you like put like the heart thing which you can do if you&amp;#39;re the creator of the video but like it had one thumbs up and that was probably you I like spent probably like 5 minutes like you know coming with this really compliment I think Brad traversy who runs uh you know uh traversy media he&amp;#39;s jumped in he&amp;#39;s like great video and it had like 2,000 upvotes and like so I I genuinely believe that YouTube is like heavily biased on toward people who leave comments within the first few minutes those are the ones that people are going to like and it those are the comments that are going to rise to the top so if anybody ever leaves a video and you feel neglected or if you ever leave a comment on a video and you feel neglected know that I&amp;#39;m right there with you and that I feel robbed by YouTube&amp;#39;s comment algorithm I spent so much time coming up like 5 minutes of My Life coming up with that comment and nobody saw it yeah anyway definitely heavily weighted toward the early early stuff yeah so uh so you&amp;#39;ve got approximately uh $3,000 a month uh in income uh and you&amp;#39;re paying a th000 of that just to uh private insurance and stuff like that but like where do you go from there and how do you build out this coder coder brand uh and this kind of like High touch polished like fancy animation like really high energy uh I mean it&amp;#39;s almost like you&amp;#39;re definitely the highest production Creator in the uh tutorial space in my humble opinion oh unless missing like I don&amp;#39;t know anybody that like puts as much thought and deliberation into every minute of a video as you do yeah I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
