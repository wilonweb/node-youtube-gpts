flexibility to take more risks if I were a single person uh and I didn&amp;#39;t have like and I also had like a lot of savings and I&amp;#39;ve famously plowed like $150,000 of my own Savings in a free Cod camp and that was money that like I earned over like 10 years working as a teacher basically like you can imagine what a teacher I basically saved half of everything I I earned and I also like hustled back in the day like you hear about this all the time and I&amp;#39;m not sure if you can even make money on it anymore but I I would like buy tons of old like video games and stuff that like Collectibles things like that on Craigslist go to like you know buy Big Lots of these things and then I break them down and sell them kind of piece them out on eBay and sell them that way and that so that&amp;#39;s how I like the the small fortune you know $150,000 that I used to fund develop like the first few years of free Camp before we got our tax income status but the entire time of course we also had my wife&amp;#39;s income so it just uh so so I always like to point out like your situation your circumstances are going to be different from mine and Jessica so just factor that in your mileage May VAR and also factor that in when you hear these getrich quick schemer type people or like these like oh like the you know the hustle culture Bros and people like that right like you know there is risk in trying to become a Creator there is risk in trying to become a freelancer there&amp;#39;s risk in taking time off to like learn to code in hopes of getting a developer job and uh I think people are remiss when they don&amp;#39;t acknowledge that risk but anyway sorry with that sidebar your husband um yeah so my husband actually is also a freelancer so unfortunately we are paying um out of pocket for Private health insurance and it&amp;#39;s like very expensive um I think I remember I had a friend who was talking to who lives in Canada and I was talking about how we have to pay for our own health insurance he&amp;#39;s like oh like how much is it I was like you know it&amp;#39;s like $1,000 a month for like two people and she was like what because like she was and she was like I&amp;#39;m complaining about spending $50 a month on my Canadian health insurance so like that was just like a huge like I think eye opening moment for yeah yeah so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very expensive in America to pay for insurance yourself um but we I think we make it work because we do have savings and we also live in kind of a lower um cost of what&amp;#39;s it called cost of living lower cost of living part of the country so that helps too um cuz you know if you want to live in like LA or New York or you know wherever it&amp;#39;s like I think there&amp;#39;s definitely obviously benefits to that and there&amp;#39;s a reason why so many people want to live there but you know I remember reading about um Chris coyer from CSS tricks and finding out that he lives like up in Wisconsin or something and I think that was for me at least the realization of like oh you can like still have a really big online presence and be a part of you know the whole Community but you don&amp;#39;t have to live in like these bigname cities so yeah I think that yeah a lot of those those Heavies as I like to call them in the teaching space you know Chris Kyer of course uh great dude whom we hope to have uh on the podcast at some point uh yes West boss Scott stalinsky uh like a lot of the kind of like the I guess the people that preceded me uh like like whom I looked up to and learned from very early on and probably you and like a lot of other people also look up to and learned from them they live out in the middle of nowhere and and like yeah and so you don&amp;#39;t have to live in SF it absolutely helps and I did live in SF during the early first few years um free cooking SF San Francisco I moved out there because that&amp;#39;s the tech Mecca and for me it wasn&amp;#39;t that big a deal because I was already living in like Southern California so I just went up there and slept on my friend&amp;#39;s couch uh for a few months and then I eventually was able my wife was able to transfer within her company up there and we were able to make it work inff but we we&amp;#39;re
