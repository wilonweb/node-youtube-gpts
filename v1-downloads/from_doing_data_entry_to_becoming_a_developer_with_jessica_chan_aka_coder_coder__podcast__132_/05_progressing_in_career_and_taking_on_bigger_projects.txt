end and I I&amp;#39;m like Soup To Nuts uh full stack Dev basically that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s got to be still have a notebook I do have to say I I still I didn&amp;#39;t have a physical notebook as much but it was more like I would keep track of notes like online that&amp;#39;s actually how the blogging thing started cuzz I started a blog spot just to write down the notes so I could quickly um refer back to them based on the the tags and stuff so that&amp;#39;s kind of how I started the developer blog thing notes for myself man that that is a blast from the past so uh I know right there was this Blogspot and blogger were they were the same right they were the same yeah the domain was blog spot but it was called blogger great branding yeah it&amp;#39;s very not confuse anybody right so if you read this book uh it&amp;#39;s called the founders at work great classic book that every startup founder has to written by Jessica Livingston uh YC you know board member why combinator board member there&amp;#39;s this amazing interview with EV Williams uh where he was running blogger and he had to fire everybody they ran out of money at one point because he was such a bad you know developer like CEO I I no shade to him but he&amp;#39;s not the greatest CEO on earth right as we&amp;#39;ve seen time and time again right so uh then he went on to found Twitter and medium and all these other uh websites but um yeah man like that is a harrowing tale that&amp;#39;s by far the best interview in the book is the the tale of kind of ineptitude that led the vlogger almost being destroyed until Google swooped it and saved it the 11th hour but uh that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a cool website so you started blogging on there just as a way to track your own learning like I just take and email them to myself and then I search them in Google right like they&amp;#39;re personal but you were actually publicly you were learning in public as Sha Wang likes to say like you were learning in public before it was the thing to do uh you were kind of like one of the early adopters of just yeting your learnings out into the stratosphere yeah I mean I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to build an audience or whatever this is kind of before everyone was trying to do that it was really just I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting anyone to find my blog and I don&amp;#39;t think anyone public ever really discovered it cuz like it was just these random notes on like SQL and c and CSS and stuff yeah but it got the uh kind of like technical writing creative Creator engine going right like the the Jessica Chan the coder coder that we know today is ultimately a consequence of you sharing your learning online right yeah for sure and I think yeah looking back I think that notes blog did help me sort of eventually choose the Cod or coder Direction yeah so you&amp;#39;re working at this agency you&amp;#39;ve been there for six years um at what point did you start like seriously taking or taking seriously the notion that like hey I could create tutorials on YouTube or I could write blog posts that actually help people like actually having an audience in mind rather than just yourself as your future self as the audience yeah um so I would have to say this whole time as I&amp;#39;d mentioned like I just enjoyed setting up blogs just for fun I also had this kind of like maybe entrepreneurial interest even from when I was a young kid like I remember when I was young I made this like vending machine out of a shoe box and I tried to sell it to my siblings and like I would just put like random candy and like peanuts in it and trying to make money off of them so I feel like I always was interested in not necessarily like making a lot of money and getting rich but again kind of creating this entity that worked in terms of operating as a business and letting me be autonomous which is a huge sort of core desire of my of mine like I really like the idea of kind of being independent and not having to be dependent on say a company or whatever um for my livelihood so I think you know when when you&amp;#39;re working at a company I think there&amp;#39;s good and there&amp;#39;s bad and I think I saw both of those um in my time at the agency we had I think maybe one or two layoffs and those are incredibly demoralizing for the people who are laid off obviously but also the people who are left and it kind of really hits home that the company&amp;#39;s not there to like help you like the company&amp;#39;s there to exist as its own and you are it&amp;#39;s kind of being built on the backs of the people working there every day so I think maybe with a little bit of um disillusionment I would say with the you know the whole like getting a corporate job and they&amp;#39;ll take care of you and give you benefits y y which was very good um but I think and that may have been how it was back in the day when there was like zero competition like nobody went to college and uh you know if you served in the war that was probably good enough for you to be up to be like an executive and an advertising agency if you seen Mad Men like they always make fun of the college kids cuz they went to war when the college kids just went and like lived these yepy Lifestyles and stuff uh but but like things used to be a lot less competitive people would just drink martinis all day and like it was uh you know I mean like things have gotten so incredibly intensely competitive over the last 30 or 40 years and I I don&amp;#39;t think cut old folks understand frankly there&amp;#39;s like a like a lack of empathy from like you know a lot of older folks I don&amp;#39;t want to say all older folks there are definitely you know people from previous you know like people in their 70s and &amp;#39; 80s that do understand how hard young people have it but it has gotten so intensely competitive that uh any kind of like social contract between an employer and an employee that may used to exist when you were like a you know an IBM man or something like that right that is long gone right like there&amp;#39;s nobody that can&amp;#39;t be fired basically unless you&amp;#39;re Mark Zuckerberg and you have like Ironclad control of like the the preferred chairs and you nobody can fire you like he can&amp;#39;t get fired right Travis K in theory couldn&amp;#39;t have been fired from Uber he he also had like super majority like shares and stuff he ultimately stepped down because there was just so much pressure on him if you watch super pumped on Netflix great show about entrepreneurialism not uh not safe for kids um to check it out it&amp;#39;s great show I I&amp;#39;ve talked about it before and I I do recommend super pumped uh with perhaps one of my favorite actors uh today uh Joseph Gordon Levitz he does a great job representing Travis K the the most mocky valant business figure of our time but what I&amp;#39;m just trying to get to is like like anybody who says like we&amp;#39;re a family you know blah like you know like run the other way if your employer doesn&amp;#39;t accept that there is you know like you&amp;#39;re a mercenary essentially uh and you can really like working at the job but at the same time just know that um you know companies ultimately have to respond to incentives from you know investors and other people like that and like you&amp;#39;re just one of many people they don&amp;#39;t like laying people off I don&amp;#39;t think anybody enjoys let letting people go but as you saw twice just on the front lines your your colleagues getting let go like that that happens and um yeah that was that one of the reasons why you like ultimately wanted to get out of the proverbial Rat Race and like become independent I think eventually but I think I I also had sort of discovered the whole like idea of blogging as like a income Source um I think you know this is back in the I would say maybe 2010s or so this is when blogging was like really I would say at its peak with like you could you could make money off of like affiliate links and all this kind of stuff and so I think I since I loved blogging I was like oh this could be something that I could do and I think I was kind of searching for a way that I could make money on my own without having to be dependent on a company and I&amp;#39;d read this book called um the $100 startup by Chris Gilbo um and I remember this is this is how coder coder started so like I was on a flight to Japan to visit my friend and I was reading this startup book on the plane and Chris Gilbo asks you like okay to figure out what business idea you can come up with like what are you passionate about and what can you know you what can you do to help other people and so for me I was like oh I would say I&amp;#39;m passionate about coding I really enjoy building websites and I think it&amp;#39;s a skill that I could you know share with other people and help them to basically do what I did because you know coding took me from working these temporary office gigs to having like a very stable like well-paying career and so I felt like that moment of realization of like oh I should do this like I want to do this and so that&amp;#39;s kind of how I started like getting more serious about writing coding tutorials on my blog and then I also got into Instagram I found out there was like a whole develop our community on Instagram which was like really cool because um in my job like my co-workers were great but like I only had worked with like male co-workers like there were no other women um like at my job the entire time that I worked there so seeing on Instagram that there
