definitely a lot of really great creators in the space like fire ship and um there&amp;#39;s like some new channel that are pretty pretty good like hyperplex a lot of Animation Stu but yeah thank you you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re very kind I will pass on the the compliments to my husband um yeah so sorry the question is like how do I yeah like how do things unfold from there like like what what are some of the main things you&amp;#39;ve learned creating these video tutorials I would actually say that yes I acknowledge I have a very unfair advantage in terms of being married to an incredibly talented animator and editor um but I would actually say that you can&amp;#39;t rely you can&amp;#39;t just Coast on like the sizzle you do need to have like content so I think I would actually say that one of the main maybe benefits of my videos that I really try to go in depth in the tutorials so like I spend a lot of time when I&amp;#39;m writing scripts for the videos one writing a script because I&amp;#39;m terrible ad living I&amp;#39;ve gotten better over time but um I like writing everything out and I do a lot of research on like I read like the um Mozilla developer Network a lot I also read the actual like um what is it the the HTML spec from the the W3 and that is like bedtime reading it&amp;#39;s like incredibly dense and hard to pick out the meaning but you know I do it when I have to so I would say that like I try really hard to do a lot of depth research but also present that in-depth information in a way that is accessible to people who are not you know experts in the field because I think that&amp;#39;s really important to be able to talk to people at the level that they&amp;#39;re at and sort of guide them through their own Learning Journey so that&amp;#39;s I would say that&amp;#39;s the most important thing that I try to do in all my videos so research
