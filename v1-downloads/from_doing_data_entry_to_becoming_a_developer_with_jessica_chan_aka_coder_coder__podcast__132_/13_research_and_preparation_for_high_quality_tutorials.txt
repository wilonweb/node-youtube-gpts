but I will say there&amp;#39;s this guy on YouTube called struthless he&amp;#39;s a tattoo artist but he makes really cool videos on a lot of them are like productivity and motivation and stuff like that and just like artistic stuff and he had this whole video on motivation and he named something called the dark why so it&amp;#39;s this idea that when we think about motivation we want to think like oh like I&amp;#39;m you know it&amp;#39;s like all good it&amp;#39;s all like positive stuff but in reality people are really motivated by either getting away from or proving something wrong or like avoiding these like bad things that we don&amp;#39;t want to happen and I think that that is true for me for sure so for example I&amp;#39;ve been working on this course for like I don&amp;#39;t know how how many years now it&amp;#39;s been again a big struggle but I think um when I had a early access launch back in November um last year that was my like drop dead deadline where it&amp;#39;s like this has to be done before that point otherwise I&amp;#39;ve already said it publicly what the launch date is I&amp;#39;m going to like hugely embarrass myself and also disappoint myself if I don&amp;#39;t make that deadline so once I had that external deadline that really like lit a fire under my butt and got me to just like the finish line so I think I think a lot of it is just figuring out how you operate and what things actually can motivate you um but yeah also not to sound cliche but I think not letting myself scroll on Reddit all the time helped a lot so just kind of like limiting that social media phone time I think helps helps your brain yeah 100% I will second that uh I um I don&amp;#39;t spend any time on Reddit uh in fact Reddit timed me out as a mod for my own subreddit oh no R free Coke camp like I in like inactive status it&amp;#39;s this badge and I&amp;#39;m the I&amp;#39;m the mod like I created the free C Camp subred right and they won&amp;#39;t let me like add Naomi from our team as a as a mom because I&amp;#39;m inactive so I have to post on Reddit and like you see me posting on Reddit just say hey great job like I mean it I am impressed by the project he just submitted but like I&amp;#39;m also trying to get reddit&amp;#39;s algorithm to uh to say like okay he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s active again he can add new me as a mod now so uh but but yeah like that like the amount of time I spent on social media is like vanishingly small and it used to be this huge good part like I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve definitely mellowed out not spending time there um yeah not that it&amp;#39;s not incredibly useful yeah but but yeah you&amp;#39;ve worked for yourself for a long time like have how do you sort of stay motivated because it feels like you&amp;#39;re working on like 20 different amazing things at the same time well thank you uh I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m glad it looks good from the outside because every organization from the inside like every person&amp;#39;s life I think feels like it&amp;#39;s probably a mess because you have access to all the gritty details um but I mean like like one of our guests um Phoebe vong Fidel um she talked about how like having kids was like the biggest productivity Boon in her life cuz suddenly she had to be accountable of the kid and it took up so much of her time that she had to figure out how to like structure the rest of her time so that she could be as productive as she was before she had kids and that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a great interview recommend everybody check it out um but but like you know she learned like you she learned a code at like 36 or something right and uh it it was having that extrinsic pressure of like I&amp;#39;ve got this kid that&amp;#39;s constantly crying and I need to get things done in between dealing with this kid and like I I would say like the first few years of free COC I was just pure ID I don&amp;#39;t know what to say but but it&amp;#39;s was just like like I really don&amp;#39;t like for-profit education I don&amp;#39;t like student debt I don&amp;#39;t like like it it was kind of like a rage that was driving me and it&amp;#39;s a dark why yeah my dark why I like I am so upset that we&amp;#39;re in the most prosperous country in the world and that there&amp;#39;s suffering that there&amp;#39;s homelessness that there are uh people who don&amp;#39;t have access to opportunity just because of where they were born if they were born in like Appalachia or you know uh Middle America like where I was where I grew up and there just was an expectation that like you&amp;#39;d be a construction worker when you grew up or something like that right like uh I definitely that was what fired me up initially was just like wanting to destroy the for-profit education complex and make education free like I and I still feel that way but I&amp;#39;ve mellowed out a lot and a lot of my productivity is not based on emotion it&amp;#39;s based on like okay like I&amp;#39;ve got systems that keep me accountable like I wake up at 7:00 a.m. every day because I&amp;#39;ve got kids and they&amp;#39;re like roosters and they jump out of bed at 7:00 a.m. full energy and you&amp;#39;re up when they&amp;#39;re up right there&amp;#39;s no sleeping through kids jumping on your bed and like uh you know stealing your phone and watching like Zelda videos at full blast and stuff like that um yeah so so like that that is kind of and and then just like all the normal diet exercise like if you live in one place for long enough uh and you you establish some routines you you can kind of Coast on those routines uh like you know like like today I woke up took my kids to school uh I went to the YMCA I exercised I walked home entire time I was thinking about this interview and like preparing and I I did my research I had like three pages of notes I was you know questions I was going to ask it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of prep uh and then that prep carries you you know sorry for that little like weird inhale thing um I&amp;#39;m not going to edit it out because I don&amp;#39;t edit okay keep um yeah uh I I feel like people need a source of like real human beings on the internet who are not fronting and Max you know who were just being themselves and uh not trying to impress people I&amp;#39;m not trying to impress anybody I&amp;#39;m trying to teach people and you know potentially Enlighten them about the nature of reality it&amp;#39;s not these perfect human beings it&amp;#39;s not like James Bond not getting killed the first time he goes on a mission because he&amp;#39;s a ostentatious bastard you know he be the worst spy the real spies you never even hear about right so anyway true so um I want to draw some more insight out of you because you just have some and and I also want to be mindful of your time uh so uh we have like 13 minutes I&amp;#39;m just going to start firing away all right you&amp;#39;re very you&amp;#39;re very vocal about uh how how you look things up all the time like this is a huge part of your message to developers it&amp;#39;s like developers are not omniscient they don&amp;#39;t have like Tic memories where they&amp;#39;ve just committed the mdn to their brain right you&amp;#39;re constantly looking things up and can you talk about that and like how you did you ever did you feel weird about that when you were like aren&amp;#39;t developers supposed to be smart and just know this stuff yeah I mean I think I was lucky that I when I was starting out in my career like I had other developers around me and I think it was it seemed pretty accepted that everyone looked up stuff all the time so I think that at least I didn&amp;#39;t have any sort of like you know false impressions of what a real real developer does but I noticed that when I started putting out some videos I think early on I did these live coding um live streams actually on my channel and I would try to build a website from a design which is my whole shtick I guess and I would spend a lot of time looking things up on stack Overflow or reading the docs and I used to remember getting all these comments from people being like Oh my gosh like real developers like do lookup stuff and so I think that really like sort of stuck with me that if you&amp;#39;re just learning how to code on your own and you don&amp;#39;t have any knowledge about the industry like it&amp;#39;s very easy to think like oh these people on YouTube or professionals working at companies like they don&amp;#39;t have to look anything up like everything is just like living in their brain 247 and it&amp;#39;s just like a library up there but that&amp;#39;s really not true because there&amp;#39;s just so much knowledge there&amp;#39;s so many areas in programming and web development and also things are changing all the time especially now nowadays um yeah things just change so quickly so you have to that&amp;#39;s just part of the routine so I think it&amp;#39;s really important for me to like keep it real and just like show people people like real web developers like look up stuff all the time yeah and it&amp;#39;s not going to get any better like like it&amp;#39;s always going to be like that because by definition the field is like people operating at the frontier of what the tools are capable of if the tool abstracted something away then you wouldn&amp;#39;t need to do that anymore so you&amp;#39;re always going to be working with like higher and higher levels of abstraction probably unless you have like really crazy constraints like we need this chip to work on this satellite and it needs to work for 2,000 years or something like that right yeah so um Okay so you know those kind of edge cases aside like you&amp;#39;re going to be using lots of tools you&amp;#39;re going to be using the raw compute power and like all the other stuff that gets better every year what kind of uh when you were developing uh websites and apps as a consultant what were kind of your bread and butter types of elements and things that you just build over and over again H that&amp;#39;s a really good question um I think like the whole like card UI where it&amp;#39;s like you have different cards with like photos and like things like that and I think just when I was learning it there was no flex box initially so you had to like lay out things with CSS float which was kind of a nightmare um but yeah I think just like getting good at these sort of multi column layouts that stack to one column on mobile like that was I would say 90% of my job um working in advertising and marketing yeah were there any UI kind of dark patterns that you&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;m I refuse to do this I mean I mean personally I think carousels are just a huge waste of time and they don&amp;#39;t work because no one never clicks to the second slide in the carousel but carousels basically exist so that you can tell the marketing higher ups that the content they wanted to put on the homepage is on the homepage it&amp;#39;s just on slide seven um so I I consider Carousel is a little bit of a pattern that I would not I don&amp;#39;t think anything that&amp;#39;s like an anti- pattern but like a dark pattern like something that you think is like manipulative of users or maybe something that where there&amp;#39;s like an ethical gray area oh like Adobe unsubscribing yeah or LinkedIn the the the uh master of dark patterns like hey would you like to tell your friends that that oh your friend&amp;#39;s not LinkedIn would you like to like import your inbox and every single person you&amp;#39;ve ever like emailed and like send them an email say hey why aren&amp;#39;t you on LinkedIn they did that like five times like they said they do it once and even the way they asked it was really sketchy anyway I don&amp;#39;t want to hammer L too much but they they did so many sketch things to uh to build that out initially but but but you said AI uh Adobe like unsubscribe but are there any dark patterns that uh you you&amp;#39;ve like felt really bad about like implementing just because your boss told you to implement or is there anything that like an ethical line that you&amp;#39;ll never cross again yeah I mean I was fortunate that I think I didn&amp;#39;t have I was never asked to do something that I felt ethically like questionable about um but yeah I think anything that like leverages is like your real life information or personal information I think you know for social credit or whatever on the app is like something that I think I would never I would never want to do that um yeah anything that that tries to get you to import your entire like contact list from your phone to the and give all your personal data to the app is like I think pretty bad yeah 100% agreed um so in terms of like gradually you&amp;#39;re somebody who focuses on expanding their skills all the time in terms of strategies you&amp;#39;ve used to like learn things like what is something that if if somebody wanted to learn an entire new area like let&amp;#39;s say they&amp;#39;re a front end developer and they want to learn backend so they can do full stack development like are there any particular strategies or advice that you would give to somebody that wanted to absorb an entire new you know Corpus of knowledge yeah I think if I was trying to to learn something new in programming I think I would definitely go to YouTube first I would go to YouTube and see what videos are kind of the most popular for for example a search term for like you know xyz4 beginners um I think I&amp;#39;d also probably I would probably check out Reddit I think Reddit is a good source of like real information from like real people usually especially for like learning I think it&amp;#39;s really good um because there&amp;#39;s always going to be someone posting like I want to learn this and that like how do I get started and then people who are more ahead of you have like good recommendations I feel like um yeah so I think just I think learning how to just figure learning how to identify what a good resource is versus a not good resource I think is kind of important um yeah are there any like telltale signs uh what is going to be like my biggest concern is not necessarily the quality of the resource but like how much of the resource you&amp;#39;re going to get before they slim a pay wall your face and like oh I just spent like half an hour learning this tutorial and suddenly like I can&amp;#39;t Advance any further you know like pay walls are really annoying I understand that that you know code academy and websites like that have to keep the lights on uh but uh it&amp;#39;s all like sometimes I wonder if they&amp;#39;re not sufficiently forthcoming about what the course actually includes for free before you have to start like you know inputting your credit card but sure are there any um just just to re rephrase my questions this is a Meandering thing um are there are there any like telltale signs of like hey this is going to be too superficial like I shouldn&amp;#39;t cuz you can watch the same you know C in 3 minutes not to pick on because he does it inest Fire Ship does like ingest how C Works in three minutes there&amp;#39;s not an expectation you&amp;#39;re learn CP in 3 minutes but like you can watch the same like HTML explained for forgetters like 30 minute tutorial like you can watch 20 of those and you wouldn&amp;#39;t really be any better than if you just watched one or two of them right like uh how do you identify a a good resource um I personally I sort of look at the tone of how the information is conveyed so if someone starts the video like how to learn HTML and they&amp;#39;re like what&amp;#39;s up like I&amp;#39;m here to show you and it it feels a little bit too like um there&amp;#39;s like a certain energy that like sort of makes me naturally distrust the person but so I feel like and this is again just maybe my own personal preferences but if I feel like the person teaching me something seems like they are more like serious or more it seems like they&amp;#39;ve really put time into explaining things well I think that&amp;#39;s a good sign I think also you can look at a channel and this is just for YouTube resources but you know for example Kevin pal all his videos are about CSS they are incredibly in depth and I think people kind of recognize that over time um and they and he explains things really well and so I think that looking at sort of their body of work on their Channel and seeing how you know either shallow or how in-depth they go on the topics I think if you do a little bit of research and just kind of yeah see for yourself like how the teaching kind of sounds so I think yeah whether they&amp;#39;re talking authoritatively or it looks like they&amp;#39;re reading a script that was probably generated by gbt or something right yeah yeah uh and Kevin Powell the king of CSS he does not like it when I call him that but that is like the the moniker that he has uh he&amp;#39;s given by the community yes uh last question what are some biggest what do you think the biggest misconceptions uh people have about learning the code when they&amp;#39;re just watching a bunch of YouTube videos like what are some misconceptions that you want to just shoot down real quick to like reassure people no that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not how it really is I would say um you don&amp;#39;t have to be on The Cutting Edge this might be an unpopular opinion but it is my opinion I don&amp;#39;t operate on The Cutting Edge and I don&amp;#39;t think you need to excuse me um I think like especially when it comes to content creators in programming like you&amp;#39;re trying to make a video that gets views so people will always make videos on like the next you know new hottest technology out there or newest framework or whatever but the reality is a lot of companies are using jQuery or they&amp;#39;re using Wordpress or you know they&amp;#39;re not using like the newest CSS feature that&amp;#39;s not like um supported by like the majority of browsers so I would say don&amp;#39;t worry about learning the newest hottest thing right now I would say just stick to the basics especially if you&amp;#39;re at the beginning of your Learning Journey and you can always learn newer things like later on CU if you learn the new things now they may or may not be hit the mainstream and then you&amp;#39;ll have in some ways maybe wasted some time that you could have spent just kind of focusing on the basics so that&amp;#39;s my biggest piece of advice yeah 100% that&amp;#39;s a great note to end on Jessica it&amp;#39;s been such a blast learning more about you learning from you I&amp;#39;ve got like 160 lines of notes in my uh editor here I&amp;#39;ve learned a tremendous amount and uh it&amp;#39;s just such an amazing blessing to have you in the developer Community creating tutorials focusing on delivering substance for the people right and and uh you know we&amp;#39;re all excited about your your big course that you you&amp;#39;re working on best of luck continuing progress on that and again I just want to emphasize like over the years you&amp;#39;ve contributed so many tutorials to the Freo Camp uh text based like publication got some video courses from you like I am always really really hyped up and really jazzed whenever Bo mentions oh yeah I heard from Jessica you know so so like thank you for everything you&amp;#39;re doing for the community yeah hopefully I can do more once this course is done with but yeah yeah love the free code Camp Community absolutely well thanks again for just providing like a really cool like I guess model of someone who has gone out and uh blazed their own path and who has transitioned from working in a field that like basically just cratered um I mean you talk about like having to go work as a temp with a college degree it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a position that I did that too I worked uh doing like their temp agencies in Oklahoma City and I did that that whole thing for for a few years and it was miserable uh but but being able to find a way out of that being able to build up a skill set being able to you know do have a choice whether you want to do freelance work or for or continue to work for previous employers or work for your your friends new employers and stuff like that or um just continue to create content on your own like having that level of agency that level of security that that uh being being the master of your own destiny I think it&amp;#39;s incredibly inspiring and I love how you don&amp;#39;t sugarcoat any of this and you don&amp;#39;t seem to take any of this for granted you&amp;#39;re out there getting things done and you&amp;#39;re working just as hard as you were before so uh it&amp;#39;s a huge source of inspiration for me awesome yeah thanks so much for having me on yeah well everybody until next week happy coding
