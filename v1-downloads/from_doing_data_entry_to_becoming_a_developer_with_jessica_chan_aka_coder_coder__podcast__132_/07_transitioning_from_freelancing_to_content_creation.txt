blogging and as you said in the early 2010s blogging was at its Heyday you could slap AdSense on a blog or potentially get like sponsorships or do other things like that and you could actually make real money blogging now can you make real money blogging well I am going to tell you how much money free Cod camps publication Mi right we do uh millions of page views a month uh on that and we just have like Google AdSense running and I think we make like maybe like 10 or 15K a month from like the ads the show on there it&amp;#39;s not a lot of money when you consider like the entire staff millions of and yeah like like we have an editorial team uh we we have a a ton of volunteer contributors who write their excellent tutorials and publish up there I published my entire book if you Google learn the code book it&amp;#39;s free it&amp;#39;s all on freecodecamp.org newsnews that&amp;#39;s our publication um and we published tons of tutorials there every week we probably publish like 20 tutorials a week and including a lot of full length books and handbooks we&amp;#39;ve got more than 100 books through freeo Camp press which is really just us publishing through our CMS but uh yeah like there&amp;#39;s no way that I was like an individual author trying to live off AdSense that I&amp;#39;d be able to right we&amp;#39;ve got like all this momentum from SEO and like just being around and like having reputation and all everything we do free Cod Camp kind of like feeds into like people knowing that free Cod Camp exists I wear the free Cod camp shirt literally everywhere I go you know it&amp;#39;s like FR I&amp;#39;ve got like 10 of these and I just wear them every day um it&amp;#39;s my uniform I got to be a billboard for for this charity right uh so so you know 15K I don&amp;#39;t imagine you were making even close to 15K off just ad ad Revenue but like maybe you could talk about how you were able to gradually become more of a content creator and less of a uh freelancer yeah so I think it grew I would say pretty slowly so like initially I had the blog and I don&amp;#39;t know if I even put ads on the blog initially I think the only way I was making money was Amazon affiliate links um and it was doing like it was doing okay but it wasn&amp;#39;t like I mean when you say okay if you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind giving like could you could you tell us um if I can remember I would would [Music] say maybe like I would say $200 a month would be pretty good oh wow okay so so that&amp;#39;s from Amazon affiliate links like yeah and now if you try to do Amazon affiliate links I think I&amp;#39;ve heard it&amp;#39;s a lot less like they really don&amp;#39;t care about the affiliate Market yeah yeah so I think that the the the landscape in terms of online like moneymaking has definitely changed you cannot you cannot live off of ads and affiliate links alone you you need other you need other Diversified channels of income for sure yeah yeah so um what were your what was your like I guess Revenue stack if you will like how were you able to like uh to make it work yeah so I think things changed a lot when I decided to go into YouTube um and not just writing text tutorials but like you know doing these screencasts and other things and so that started probably it was had like like stops and starts so I think the first YouTube video was uploaded in like 2017 and then I didn&amp;#39;t upload another video for like a year or two years um but I did eventually start being more consistent about uploading videos and things started taking off in 2020 like I think when the pandemic hit everyone was just like online 24/7 so like back then there were a lot of people watching YouTube videos so that was kind of when my channel started growing a lot and I was able to make money off of AdSense I think maybe since then maybe the max that I would do was like 1,500 a month from just AdSense which was pretty good um and then I also had some affiliate links and that was bringing in about the same per month um but okay so so you&amp;#39;re making about $33,000 a month just as a Creator and you&amp;#39;re still doing Consulting work at this point or were you I was doing freelancing um and then at some point I was like I think when I hit that three 3K a month Mark I was like all right let&amp;#39;s like just try to do coder coder and not do freelance anymore so I stopped doing freelance I would say maybe 20 22 just like just like a couple years ago yeah and to put this in context like for a lot of people listening to this they may be single or uh not like Mar or you know maybe in a situation where they they are not able to get health insurance your your husband uh is an accomplished animator uh if you wouldn&amp;#39;t talk if you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind talking a little bit about him and like the role he played in you being able to make this transition cuz my wife was absolutely instrumental and me being able to make the trans transition she was working you know in Tech doing accounting and we had health insurance she wasn&amp;#39;t making just a ton of money cuz she was she wasn&amp;#39;t a developer she was like doing accounting and stuff and which is like half a quarter of 10th of what developers make but uh but that insurance was very helpful and also the fact that we just had like a consistent Baseline like the rent was basically covered just from her income and stuff uh so that gave me the
