and preparation so by the time you like turn on the camera or turn on the mics you&amp;#39;ve already spent a great deal of time thinking about the topic that you&amp;#39;re going to talk about and uh yeah and and it shows it comes through in your videos that you&amp;#39;re like pretty authoritative and and you&amp;#39;re pretty definitive um and and also it&amp;#39;s just like really compressed like you said Fire Ship is famous for having like these three minute videos that are funny and just like overload of memes and stuff like that um and like like C in three minutes or something like that right like those kinds of videos those are cool those those are fun uh and then you have like the polar opposite where these long winding conversations between two people who have done stuff you know over here on the freeo camp podcast right so um zero production value just just Personality yeah so good content yeah exactly and like again I listen to so many pocket people like I I interviewed Scott uh sininsky not Scott Selinsky uh Scott the other Pro Scott Hanselman yes he like how do you do it like who listen list to this stuff like who has time to listen to but I listen to this stuff all the time I learned so much for like long interviews um and I feel like they they surface a whole lot of you know interesting stuff that wouldn&amp;#39;t come out in like a polished like if you were to go on Good Morning America which uh you know is like like you&amp;#39;re lucky if they take like three sentences of what you say and put it on there right so for sure I I have so many questions for you we haven&amp;#39;t even gotten to them and I&amp;#39;m just going to start firing them off sure right uh so you worked seven years at your first job would you recommend people stay at their first job for seven years I think if it works for you I think if I stayed as long as I did because I felt like I was constantly learning and like I didn&amp;#39;t plateau and I felt like it was a reasonably not toxic environment for the most part and so I think it really depends on the situation but I do think that it can be a benefit to start at one company and kind of you know work your way up and get experience there um yeah varies you yeah absolutely you have a really cool like background like area it looks like you got a nice bookshelf you may actually have the same it&amp;#39;s not the same bookshelf it&amp;#39;s a similar bookshelf I got it on like Wayfair but but like you&amp;#39;ve got like a cool kind of like setup over there and like I imagine you know you&amp;#39;re into like mechanical keyboards and stuff like that uh like just like the Aesthetics of getting work done mhm especially as like an more artist artistic minded person who who is like studyed photography and probably like you know you know Mary condo cell like looks thinks about like all the different little details and stuff right I try so maybe you could talk about your setup and like how you get in your happy place for getting work done oh yeah that&amp;#39;s a big question um I&amp;#39;m going to be completely honest here so I&amp;#39;ve worked remotely for the past seven years um some of it was at the agency where I actually worked remotely and started out working in the physical office but motivation has been a huge like I cannot overestimate how much of a struggle staying motivated has been um working remotely and then also just like working for myself essentially um I&amp;#39;m still like figuring it out but like I I&amp;#39;m very embarrassed about like the thought of what I do with my day um like you&amp;#39;ve seen those videos where it&amp;#39;s like you know day in the life of a programmer and like you see all the things that they do it&amp;#39;s like everyone&amp;#39;s like waking up at 6:00 a. and stuff it&amp;#39;s like I do not wake up at 6:00 a.m. my sleep schedules can very swing widely um and I&amp;#39;m definitely not like sit down the desk for eight hours and like type away so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s been a pretty big struggle if I&amp;#39;m honest and I think you know the whole pandemic was part of that too I think um yeah yeah just made things hard but I&amp;#39;m hopefully getting better at motivating myself but it&amp;#39;s yeah it&amp;#39;s hard man especially when you&amp;#39;re just at home all the time yeah when you have to turn it on when you&amp;#39;re like man I got this deadline like or I committed to this goal of mine maybe nobody else uh knows about it but you like want to hold yourself accountable like how do you fire yourself up to to get things done do you have any sort of ritual or some sort of like fallback some sort of song that you put on that like you know the rocky them like something that you do to like to to get on point for me um yeah I&amp;#39;m still figuring that part out
