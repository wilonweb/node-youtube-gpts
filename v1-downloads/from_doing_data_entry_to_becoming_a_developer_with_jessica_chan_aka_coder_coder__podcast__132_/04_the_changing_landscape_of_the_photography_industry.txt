like did you ever get like the big fat books like um on different Technologies like yeah yeah like um I have quite a few that I actually need to donate because I don&amp;#39;t read them yeah well um I mean do you remember that era like uh of just going into a big bookstore and just be like wow like so much knowledge all this knowledge is right here yeah I need to buy this book and then there was like a CD ROM in the back oh yeah of course yep in the classic sleeve yeah very cool well so it sounds like you learned a tremendous amount there and I I&amp;#39;m excited to learn a little bit more about what transpar because it sounds like you you were kind of going through the the proverbial uh learning process but you were doing it in a way that most people don&amp;#39;t do it because most people uh nowadays in 2024 like just use freeo Camp to learn or they use some combination of courses like the courses you&amp;#39;ve developed uh or or you know video based courses or um they may use some books uh still to learn different Technologies like everybody learns a little bit different but to actually be in a shop with other devs kind of like almost kind of like I think of it as like um I mean I keep coming back to like a newsroom feel cuz it does feel like an editor just sending you out like giving you assignments and I worked in newspapers for a while and that was very much what it was like it was extremely hands off and you just like learned from your peers you learned from reading the New York Times every day and seeing what they were doing like like were you going to like Coca-Cola&amp;#39;s website and like looking at their like interaction design and stuff like that and trying to learn from it or were you studying a lot of work that was out in you know in the wild to be honest I didn&amp;#39;t because I was so overwhelmed with the work I had to do for my job during the day um and this is this is more like after I left that sort of temp job and was able to work at an advertising agency like that was like drinking from a fire hose in terms of I just had to like change this button on this landing page but like I knew that I had to get it done like in less than a day or a few hours because you know I need to meet my deadline so like it was I would say that the first three years the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at stack Overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other Developers is if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn because like every day I would have to learn you know five five new things and then you multiply that by all the days in the year and like by the end of the first year I learned like so much just from having to do all these like innumerable little tasks yeah it was so yeah I didn&amp;#39;t have free time to um try to build my skills because I was learning so much like on the job yeah interesting so like I mean would you just go home and be like exhausted like collapse in your bed like cuz learning is so hard and it&amp;#39;s so tax like I spent a lot of my time learning and and not to make it about me again but like like there are days at the end of the day my brain is so tired I it&amp;#39;s like mush because I spent the entire day like studying really hard on different topics and stuff like for me like the greatest feeling in the world the thing that I optimize and I build my life around obviously like rearing my kids and stuff like that and you know making a living and and you know running free camp but like in my free time I spend as much time as possible reading listening the podcast studying uh World languages of course shedding on the Bas woodshedding uh Charlie Parker famously goes to a Woodshed and just gets better by just practicing every day in the Woodshed and like like putting on records and learning from anyway sorry like go music tangent I&amp;#39;m obsessed with but um it sounds like your brain was kind of like expanding and you were probably I imagine again I don&amp;#39;t want to talk too much about what was theoretically going on in your parid but I imagine like there were more wrinkles getting like you know formed in there and you were like did did you feel yourself becoming more powerful and more uh capable with every day was there a sense of full momentum I I think the first year was more just like living in complete compl abject fear of losing my job um so I think it it took I would say two years I think by the end of my second year at the agency I was like okay I think I&amp;#39;m like starting to feel less panic and more like I realize I&amp;#39;m still at the early stage of the learning curve but it doesn&amp;#39;t feel as difficult and impossible as it did in the first year so it&amp;#39;s a long time but like I think the 2-year Mark was really where I was starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with and even if I didn&amp;#39;t know an answer right away I knew that I had the tools to look up and figure out the solution and I think that when I hit that point I was like okay I like subjectively like or objectively I can do pretty much anything that someone asks me I just need to have enough time to like do the research and do trial and error so it was like up to that point it was very hard but after that point I knew I was still a beginner but I felt more confident in my own ability to research and gain you know the the knowledge I needed to you know do my job so one of the takeways I&amp;#39;m getting is like as much as you were learning a and gaining competency like it was not a fun experience cuz it it sounds like like uh imposter syndrome the clinical diagnosis that every developer gets when they&amp;#39;re learning the code unless they learn the code when they&amp;#39;re a little kid and they completely forget you know like all the the trial and error and stuff um um it sounds like that was completely casting a shadow over like all the enjoyment like so this was a rough year of your life it sounds like it was rough yeah and I think personally I also don&amp;#39;t like feeling incompetent so I think that also made it even more difficult for me to not just be fearful and stressed the entire time so you know maybe other people if you&amp;#39;re more comfortable you know not being not knowing everything then maybe it would be a little easier for you but I I think I just put a lot of pressure on myself and I think that definitely contributed to how hard that first year was um yeah I was I was very grumpy yeah I I mean like I guess that was like my one thing like Saving Grace when I was like trying to learn to code over this very lengthy process like looking like a total amateure on stage at these hackathons presenting you know having my code crash and or or just like there was this one time that I went out to a hackathon and like I couldn&amp;#39;t actually get the project to work like the whole team was counting on me and we just showed a slideshow instead of showing a working prototype and that was like probably like the lowest point in my coding Journey just having let down my team uh but the one thing that like I think made it a little bit more bearable is I&amp;#39;ve always been kind of like I&amp;#39;ve never like thought I was a particularly smart or interesting or capable person I always kind of looked at myself as kind of like a uh just just not like a serious human being um and you know like Socrates like the the only thing I know is that I know nothing and I I always kind of like like you know Bill and Ted&amp;#39;s Excellent Adventure like the fact that they&amp;#39;re like these happy go-lucky kind of fools uh just stumbling into like these very important matters and stuff like that like I always kind of like looked at myself that way and that cushioned kind of the impostor syndrome I&amp;#39;m like of course I&amp;#39;m an imposter like I&amp;#39;m not that smart of a guy you know so uh it sounds like you were holding yourself to a higher standard than I was and that might have been part of the reason for the misery yeah uh you did power through it right you stayed at this job for like seven years right at the at the agency M that&amp;#39;s a long time to be at a first job but it&amp;#39;s commendable cuz cuz like you know the saying like a rolling stone gathers no Moss you were gathering tons of moss just chilling there right and you want to get moss you want to get character very Moss right you want to be an organic you know uh because Rock by itself is not organic right maybe some types of rock are like sedimentary I don&amp;#39;t know but um you know like you were building out like this character and this this Persona as a developer and and kind of coming into your own can you talk about those other six years at the agency once you&amp;#39;d kind of gotten through the first yeah kind of Hell year yeah so I would say so I think I also got promoted um twice in my time there and obviously like companies are completely relative you know everyone sort of has a different idea of like what senior means and all that stuff but I started out as um an assistant web developer so junior level and then I think after two years I got promoted to just web developer so like in the middle and then I think year four I got promoted to senior web developer um again this doesn&amp;#39;t mean I could be a senior at like Google or Facebook or whatever but I think that sort of I was it shows that I was able to progress in my career and the agency felt like I was you know contributing more and more the longer that I was there um so yeah it definitely got easier um over time and I felt more confident and less stressed and I sort of like I had a lot of fun back in my agency days cuz you know we all were it&amp;#39;s like working together on these incredibly tight timelines and St staying up late sometimes and stuff like that and I don&amp;#39;t know if I would want to do that again and have to stay up till 3:00 a.m. deploying something to production because a client needs it live exactly at that moment in time but it was a fun time and I did feel like um because I was more confident in my skills I was Al also able to take on bigger sort of scopes of work so in the last I would say few years of my time at the agency instead of doing these sort of peac meal tasks like updating this button or you know whatever building this like One landing page I would take on sort of full website builds like from scratch so for example one of our clients was a bank and so I built their website both back and front end um so I built the I set up the CMS we used craft CMS which is a a c CMS and then I also did the front end so I did I worked from the design from the designer and I did all the CSS and all that so that was very satisfying to be able to reach that point where I could actually build a project from start to finish like completely on my own so I I enjoyed that work a lot yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s sounds like quite an evolution so very beginning you don&amp;#39;t know how to do anything you&amp;#39;re like struggling to like referencing your notebook over and over that your boss is giving you you&amp;#39;re scared to ask questions probably because he&amp;#39;s created a Culture of Fear around asking questions but uh yep but by the end you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re like this kind of superhero that&amp;#39;s just like sure I can do I can learn you know CP craft new CMS I never heard of uh CMS uh I can do the front
