were like you know other people doing web development who you know looked more like me was like a really cool sense of community and so I kind of like fell into like those sort of areas in terms of like online you know webd type of stuff um so yeah that&amp;#39;s how coder coder started yeah um yeah yeah that that&amp;#39;s really cool so I mean you brought up an important point about the fact that like the field was very male-dominated um at the time and uh so just just to finish kind of like the the origin story um and establish our chronology we&amp;#39;re going to be drawing from for the rest of the conversation so you you did leave this job at the um at the agency and was that to ultimately go into freelancing yourself um yeah so I left the agency because I was trying to do freelance and sort of build up like the coder coder thing so I did end up freelancing for the agency for a little bit after even after I left um but I think it was just nice to yeah have less of the sort of expectations and everything um but yeah so I did freelance for I would say a long time maybe like three or four years um and then I I did freelancing for like other like another company as well before I quit that a couple years ago so you were able to kind of like taper off having people go out and find clients for you essentially that&amp;#39;s what like an agency does it it kind of like puts Under One Roof like both the sales side and the actual like I guess production side uh that&amp;#39;s probably an oversimplification I&amp;#39;ve never worked at an agency uh I have people that swear by working at agencies that love agency life like Cass Marino CSS artist whom you can watch an interview with here on the fre C Camp uh YouTube channel or on the uh that listen you can listen on the free C Camp podcast she&amp;#39;s amazing uh but uh I&amp;#39;m really interested in kind of like how you tapered that off and how you went out and got your own clients because that is something that a lot of people listening to this would like to ultimately freelance and have their own kind of consultancy yeah um I mean to be honest I never was like having to find my own clients because my clients were companies if that makes sense so like my first client was obviously my old agency and then um just through knowing co-workers who moved on to other companies like they were hiring Freelancers as well so I was doing freelance jobs for like their new companies and stuff like that um so I never did the the whole like you know local like try to find you know local businesses to to build up your clientele but I do know that&amp;#39;s very possible that&amp;#39;s such an interesting departure from what a lot of the other people who do fre so essentially you built like this network from working in an agency for so long uh that you already had like kind of all the connective tissue you needed to be able to just continue to Coast on those relationships yeah yeah for sure I think I had a very very yeah I&amp;#39;m very fortunate that I benefited from my my networking um back then and yeah just able to find different freelance gigs um yeah yeah and the entire time you&amp;#39;re
