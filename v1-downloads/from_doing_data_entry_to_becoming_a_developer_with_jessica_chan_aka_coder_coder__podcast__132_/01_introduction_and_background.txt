the first one to two years were incredibly stressful because I constantly felt like I was going to fail and they were going to fire me for incompetence so it was a lot of Googling it was a lot of like looking up at deack overflow trying to do as much research on my own before I actually asked one of the other developers because I was also very afraid of annoying the other developers if I bug them too much with questions so it was like I would say it was pretty difficult for me at that time but I was learning so much like I think my brain was just like expanding with the amount of things I would learn [Music] welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I&amp;#39;m Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we&amp;#39;re bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we&amp;#39;re joined by Jessica Chand AKA coder coder she&amp;#39;s a soft software engineer who has worked in the field for more than a decade and interestingly she studied Photography in school and she never even took a programming class uh and yet she&amp;#39;s had this illustrious career so we&amp;#39;re going to learn a lot from her welcome Jessica yeah thanks so much for having me yeah I uh I&amp;#39;ve been a longtime admirer of your work uh of the caliber of your husband&amp;#39;s animation sound design like all the production you put into these amazing uh video courses that you create and just your fun sense of humor and like it&amp;#39;s just like if there was like a word to describe Cod or quer I would describe it as like fun I mean that may seem kind of like a like a short word to describe it but it is fun to watch your videos that&amp;#39;s awesome yeah thank you that is definitely one one thing we we aim for with the the videos yeah so I want to like go way back as we always do and just start with like kind of how you got into Tech because my understanding is you don&amp;#39;t have any formal training en coding and in fact like your career kind of like evaporated early on as the field just fundamentally changed and uh you you found yourself like working kind of like in those kind of temp office type jobs and stuff uh for quite a while like but before we get to that like maybe you can talk a little bit about your early days and your early Ambitions yeah so as you said I didn&amp;#39;t you know go to school for anything programming wise but I was always into computers even from a pretty young age um like I remember going to the library and checking out like a book on basic programming and trying to like do that on the computer at home um and then also in I think it was middle school or High School my sister and I ran a BBS this is pre internet days a bullet and board system so that was and that was something that I kind of set up myself um and yeah that was super fun um back in the back in those days yeah how do bbs&amp;#39;s work I mean I know because I used to use them but but like what is running it a BBS like uh of course that&amp;#39;s like a major plot point in the show Halt and Catch Fire like uh they set up a BBS in the 80s but maybe maybe you could talk about what that was like cuz yeah how did you get special software did you have like a special server um we ran it off of one of the computers that we had at home so we had two computers at home so one of them you would have to run the software to run the BBS and people would actually have to physically call your the phone number attached to the computer in order to connect to the BBS from their computer um with these different protocols and everything was sort of asy art you know very slow slow speeds like 2400 bod modems and all that kind of stuff um but yeah you could log into the BBS you could there were message boards there were games you could play they were actually really fun you could also upload and download files so yeah it was just a way for people to find community and just like you know have fun in their spare time yeah and what kind of software did you have on that because I remember like when I dial into a BBS there would be like places you could like leave messages for other people kind of like a like an altnet uh uset like precursor uh but there were also lots of interactive games where you could only do so much every day so it like encouraged you to come back the next day and like bu buff up the stats of your character and like explore it was like kind of like text based Adventure type stuff yeah for sure um I ran it off of a software called Renegade so you could you didn&amp;#39;t have to code it from scratch so you could download these BBS software packages I guess and then install them on your computer and so you didn&amp;#39;t have to do any actual programming to really set it up you just had to kind of install it and configure it um so yeah no programming needed what do people use it for I used it to play games they were really fun um there was like legend of the red dragon the sort of D and D themed game where you you know fought monsters and try to get gold um there&amp;#39;s also kind of a Star Wars themed game called trade Wars where you would trade different um resources and you could like save up to get like the Enterprise type uh ship and they like fangi and stuff yeah it was it was fun fun times that&amp;#39;s pretty cool so it&amp;#39;s basically like kind of like a Commerce simulator where you you have like uh yeah that sounds fun and how many people could use the BBS concurrently like did you have multiple phone lines um it was limited to one person per phone line and we only had one phone line so yeah how did how did uh your parents feel about like having that phone line tied up all the time we yeah we&amp;#39;re pretty I would I guess privileged because my parents were willing to pay for a second phone line that was dedicated to the BBS um but yeah I limited to one person at a time which is kind of mind-blowing you know considering nowadays everything is like happening at the same time yeah maybe you could talk about like how you get the word out as a kid like did you just tell your friends at school or like how did people discover that there was this phone number they could dial into with their modem and play games and stuff I think there were places you could list your BBS but my sister and I were members of other local bbs&amp;#39;s and had made friends and stuff so you just kind of tell your friends about your own BBS and because ours was smaller it was you were less likely to get a busy signal when you tried to call in which I think the friends really liked so it was kind of like a just like a hangout place um for like us and our online friends yeah I mean that&amp;#39;s so cool because it&amp;#39;s like very local I mean it yeah I don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s like a an equivalent on the internet right now because everything is concurrent like just because I&amp;#39;m looking at somebody&amp;#39;s Instagram feed doesn&amp;#39;t mean somebody else can&amp;#39;t also look at it right or any sort of synchronous like chat type experience like using slack or using uh Discord or something like that like everything you just take for granted that it&amp;#39;s like a multi-tenant operation right um yeah so yeah I can imagine all
