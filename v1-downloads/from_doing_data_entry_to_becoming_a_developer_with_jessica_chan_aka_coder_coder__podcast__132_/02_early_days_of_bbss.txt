the constraints in terms and and also the fact that it&amp;#39;s like dealing with extremely low amounts of data so everything text ask text yeah that&amp;#39;s so cool like it was a different world how did you even discover like how did it like pop in your mind because I would use other people&amp;#39;s bbs&amp;#39;s but it never occurred to me like I should create a BBS on my own like what do you remember like was there like some uh moment of Revelation like I could do this I think looking back I think I&amp;#39;ve always had this interest in building things so before I became web developer I taught myself HTML and basic CSS in high school like this is back in the geoc C&amp;#39;s days and I just would kind of make blogs for myself but it wasn&amp;#39;t because I had all these things I wanted to say it&amp;#39;s because I just enjoyed setting up the the blog websites and I remember my friend was like sort of making fun of me a little bit because I kept just like having new blogs and I would have to send her like the new link every time um but it didn&amp;#39;t really sort of cement in my understanding that like I enjoyed making making you know blogs after blogs cuz I enjoyed building websites um but yeah I think I just always liked making things and Building Things yeah well um maybe you can talk a little bit about like your early days and and you know what your aspirations were around High School age um I think in high school I was probably I was a very goody two shoes and I think I wanted to be a doctor um cuz my dad he&amp;#39;s tired now but he was a doctor um so I think that was kind of the the limits of my aspirations for some reason I didn&amp;#39;t realize that like you could be a web developer or a programmer back then I&amp;#39;m not sure why but I just I didn&amp;#39;t really think about you know what job out of all the jobs in the world can I do I think I just sort of had a very limited sort mind mindset at that point yeah and I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a common thing uh among like a lot of people that come on the fre cocaine podcast is like they have like this mentality like oh I&amp;#39;ll be like a doctor or a lawyer or a dentist or or some kind of other type of engineer like because that&amp;#39;s what the people you know that are older than me seem to be doing in these Social Circles and they seem to be doing well they&amp;#39;ve got like the house and they they&amp;#39;ve got you know stable income and they they&amp;#39;re eventually going to be able to retire and stuff like that so so you kind of look at those people and you&amp;#39;re like wow if I just had a lot of money and I could basically just do whatever I want and like have like a really good you know sound system or whatever it was you know we aspired to when we were kids you you kind of like look at the job as just something you do as a means to an end to just have a relaxing enjoyable life and and be able to have a family and stuff like that like that&amp;#39;s how a lot of people I think look at uh when they&amp;#39;re younger they&amp;#39;re just like okay what do I do that like being a doctor you get tons of respect right uh like people call you doctor right and and like if if if somebody like has like a collapses on the sidewalk or something they&amp;#39;re like is there a doctor and you run over and everybody parts to make way for you so I can definitely understand why like I would definitely say that&amp;#39;s the most common thing that people who come on the free C Camp podcast want to be when they grow up as a doctor uh but for you that that wasn&amp;#39;t in the cards and it probably wasn&amp;#39;t for academic reasons but like why did you ultimately not decide to pursue yeah um yeah I think the the doctor thing didn&amp;#39;t last very long um so College I took I think intro to chemistry and I almost failed it and I think after that class I was like I don&amp;#39;t think this is for me because I knew the classes would only get harder and harder with like organic chemistry and like all this kind of stuff so I dropped that and then I didn&amp;#39;t know what to major in and I eventually took a drawing class and I loved it and this art is something that I had done you know since high school I took a lot of Art and photography classes in high school and I just you know really enjoyed that so I thought oh maybe I&amp;#39;ll try majoring in art so that&amp;#39;s kind of how I got into majoring in photography in school that&amp;#39;s so interesting like I I just assume because you&amp;#39;re like frankly you&amp;#39;re like a really smart person like I definitely look at you and say she&amp;#39;s probably like way smarter than me um and the reason I think that uh you know like if you look at like the caliber of your work and the way you carry yourself and talk and and stuff like this person is extremely organized and so I just presumed oh it&amp;#39;s probably not an academic reason do you ever wonder if like that was like a weer class or some sort of like like that if you could have actually probably like powered through uh doing like Premed and then medical school and stuff like that or do you genuinely think it wasn&amp;#39;t you didn&amp;#39;t have it in you I think I could have I think the the problem this is I think this is just my personal situation I like didn&amp;#39;t have a really big social life in high school I didn&amp;#39;t really have that many friends that I would hang out with so the only thing I had to do was study and read books so that&amp;#39;s basically all I did when I was younger then I went to college and you know college is like this new experience you meet all these new people so I had a lot of friends and so I in high school I didn&amp;#39;t have to really have time management skills where I&amp;#39;m choosing to study over doing something fun but in college I ended up doing a lot of fun things as opposed to studying so I would like routinely hang out with people and then I would have to stay up till like 3:00 a.m. studying and trying to finish my work um or I would just stay up till 3:00 a.m. cuz I was hanging out with people so like yeah I did not have great time management skills like at all um when I was in college which is sad to say but that&amp;#39;s kind of what happened so I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the reason why it didn&amp;#39;t really work out but I I don&amp;#39;t think I would have enjoyed all the different science classes to be honest yeah yeah so you&amp;#39;re into art um so to to resolve that tangent you&amp;#39;re into art and uh you&amp;#39;re interested uh like like where does this drawing class take you in terms of like what&amp;#39;s your progression as a creative thinker and and maker um yeah so I think the drawing class the the professor actually was like asking me she she was a painter who was doing like a temporary thing at my school and she was like I why are you not majoring in art so I think I just took that as a big compliment which you know was and that&amp;#39;s kind of how I decided to you know major in that um but in terms of artistic uh skills or whatever I think that I actually didn&amp;#39;t learn very much photography at all because my professor was very hands-off so he would just say all right go take pictures and then we would take pictures and develop them and print them and then we would like hang them up and have critiques and that was it he didn&amp;#39;t really like teach us very much so I actually taught myself more after college um cuz I lived in Boston for a long time and I was unemployed for about a month after I moved there so all I did was walk around the city and with my little Sony point and shoot camera and I just like shot photos all around the city for you know that became one of my hobbies and I think that kind of practice over and over helped me to really develop better photographic skills so I&amp;#39;m yeah I feel like you can teach yourself a lot just through trying things yeah 100% I I can I can get
