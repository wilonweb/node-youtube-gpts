behind that sentiment because that&amp;#39;s how I like kind of root Force learning coding and other things like that and it sounds like so one interesting note about what you&amp;#39;re there was actually a study like and I&amp;#39;m always like really load the quote like social science studies because they can&amp;#39;t necessarily be uh reproduced the finings can&amp;#39;t be reproduced NE early but uh I think there was like they B it was photography and and they they had like some Professor who basically said like told some of the students like I want you to just take one picture but I want it to be a really good one and the other one just go take a ton of pictures and it turned out that the people that just incidentally took a whole lot of pictures like they were practicing and their their photos were better subjectively how how do you judge a better photo but like yeah the the the researchers found that like the the students or the professors like like that I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m totally butchering the findings but the point of the study was that like it you know you can stand all day there and talk about the theory what what you know makes for a good composition of a shot what&amp;#39;s like the hierarchy and like all these other different considerations right I know nothing about photography uh but but at the same time like if you just go out and practice the actual skill maybe a lot of this you&amp;#39;ll into it and you&amp;#39;ll build it up so maybe your professor was kind of like the the equivalent of like those old uh you know um the master from the Kung Fu movies like standing there pass you know you know basically just just giving you like very vinary feedback on your work but it does sound like you some critique right um but but like maybe he had kind of internalized that like to become a good photographer you just got to go out and take a lot of photos right a lot of a lot of shots on goal so to speak um yeah that&amp;#39;s cool so you you were living in Boston so this is after college we can we can go to Life After College right like for a photography major um which I mean I I think if you took like all the different college majors and you rank them like you know Premed and like software engineering and things like that like computer science I think is like the highest compensating degree you can study overall like over like the next 20 years like something like that but like if you were to stack rank those like I&amp;#39;m pretty sure photography would be toward the bottom in terms of like remunerative careers I apologize if you can hear like some lawnmowing stuff this is just like that one day of the month can you is that coming through to you at all I cannot hear it so I think you&amp;#39;re good yeah well it dodged I don&amp;#39;t have to go out and like politely asked the gentleman to like come back later okay so um yeah so I guess my point is like no no shade at all the photography Majors like I uh you know I&amp;#39;m an English major so that&amp;#39;s also toward the bottom of the list but like when you arrive at Boston what are you thinking like why did you move to Boston first of all cuz that&amp;#39;s like a big expensive city and like you said you were unemployed for a month like did you have a job lined up or what what were your what was your thinking at this point in your life I I went I was like kind of already in the New England area and some of my friends had moved to Boston already so it seemed like the next logical step to just kind of move to the nearest big city um but yeah I looking back I can&amp;#39;t I almost can&amp;#39;t believe I did this but I just was like okay I&amp;#39;ll just move there I&amp;#39;ll find a job once I&amp;#39;m there um and the only thought I had was I&amp;#39;m going to try to be an artist because that was the only like I guess job that they really talked about at school they didn&amp;#39;t really train us to yeah think about other jobs like you know I don&amp;#39;t know going into advertising or other things like that being a commercial photographer like everything was about about the fine art stuff so anyway in Boston I was just looking for jobs related to photography and so I just called up all the Photo Labs in the area and one of them like ended up giving me a job so that&amp;#39;s kind of how I fell into I worked in a commercial photo lab and yeah that was a that was a fun experience but I did not make much money at all so when you say like a photo lab like where you going to get your photos developed like with the chemicals and stuff yep yeah so they they serviced commercial um photographers so it was a really large lab the professional photographers would come in with all their roles of film from their shoots and we would develop them we had a film guy who just all he did all day was develop all the film um and my job was to make contact sheets from the strips of film where you can see it&amp;#39;s like the size of the negatives but you can see what&amp;#39;s on them um before printing um so that was one of my jobs but yeah that was a it was a really fun experience but but definitely not doesn&amp;#39;t exist as much anymore today yeah yeah I mean with the EV a digital photography that like kind of like probably made that industry go the way of like buggy whips like there are still some people that sell buggy whips like there there are like multi hundredy old companies that produce these buggy whips and it could be that like 100 years from now there are still Photo Labs but they&amp;#39;re going to be probably very Niche yes and yeah it&amp;#39;s not like a giant industry anymore right uh like I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if that that industry had undergone like a 90% you know reduction over the past 20 years for sure if not more so okay so you&amp;#39;re working in this photo lab uh servicing uh professional uh you know photographers probably like wedding photographers the people that do like yearbook I don&amp;#39;t know like who who are the commercial what are what are the jobs in photography how did how did the photography industry work at the time um from what I could tell just from the people coming in they were like um commercial portrait photographers they do you know newspaper and magazine photos there were wedding photographers um and there also some just like fine artists who would come in um and they would have us print their their photos for them um so it was it was kind of a range I&amp;#39;m sure there were some like hobbyist photographers who were just kind of doing it for fun too yeah did did you have any ankling like hey I could do what they&amp;#39;re doing and like go out and like make kind of like a consultancy out of this or like be a freelance photographer I don&amp;#39;t know why well I sort of tried I did sort of second shooting for some wedding photographers and I interned with one of the commercial photographers who came in but for some reason it never really stuck with me in terms of oh this is something I want to do um it just seemed like I think I just didn&amp;#39;t know how to even break into the field and I didn&amp;#39;t have enough of a maybe desire to be a photographer to do the research to figure out how to do the business side of things things so yeah yeah I mean this is kind of like sorry I didn&amp;#39;t mean to interrupt you there&amp;#39;s a little bit of legy uh yeah this is like an indictment of higher education that you studied photography for like four years and you still have like no idea how to actually like go out and make money as a photographer and and you&amp;#39;re not even sure that you would want to even if you knew how but you know college just kind of put you onto this track and they give you a major important major and then there&amp;#39;s so much momentum behind it and it&amp;#39;s so hard to switch but I mean it does sound to me kind of like uh if I can like be probably over prescriptive in hand wavy but it sounds like you know uh you said you didn&amp;#39;t have a a big interesting social life uh when you were younger you go to college college is where a lot of people if you&amp;#39;re fortunate enough to go to college like their social life kind of burgeons and the whole world opens up right it&amp;#39;s not just like High School never ends type uh you know clicky things it&amp;#39;s like real people kind of like becoming friends and and around common interests and stuff like that and a lot of that kind of like high school nonsense kind of like breaks down to an extent like once you get out of like fraternity sority spheres and stuff uh and I&amp;#39;m not trying to like knock those or anything but like I was never in a fraternity and like I didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of respect for like the fraternities and stuff like we we always kind of looked a SCS at them if that&amp;#39;s how you pronounce the word like oh you know like that&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re here to learn you know like like I kind of like elevated myself above like the people doing like you know drinking excessively and stuff like that so um but it sounds like you had kind of like a social Awakening in college and then uh maybe the fact that that that was all happening distracted you from academics to an extent and when the professor was like oh you should consider being an artist or wanting to switch to Art you&amp;#39;re like sure it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like there was like a ton of Liberation and like long-term planning during those four years would you agree with that sentiment I I don&amp;#39;t want to mischaracterize it no I would definitely agree I think I just didn&amp;#39;t know what was possible so you don&amp;#39;t know what you don&amp;#39;t know and I didn&amp;#39;t really understand how I needed to think about trying to find a career or you know choosing you know which one I wanted to do um so I think it was yeah a lot of fumbling and just not really knowing what what I wanted in life I think back then but you&amp;#39;re in Boston this very expensive city uh very you know prestigious City like that&amp;#39;s where like Harvard is MIT there&amp;#39;s so many uh like big important companies based out of Boston there&amp;#39;s so much research being done there it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a really important and it&amp;#39;s one of the oldest cities in the United States so it&amp;#39;s got like this very long stored history and um and you&amp;#39;re just kind of working at a photo lab and like did you feel like ambition going to and from work every day like at what point did the more ambitious Jessica Chan start to materialize the one that we all know and respect today I think it took a while I think I I really just didn&amp;#39;t know what I wanted to do when I was in my 20s so I think it wasn&amp;#39;t really until I started working um at this small web dev shop in Boston that I was thinking oh I can like sort of stay here and learn how to program they were doing like sort of backend like database work that&amp;#39;s kind of where I started um how did you get how did you get that job um so as you probably saw in my like YouTube video I did a lot of temp office jobs for I would say a few years so this is just you know like it was fine work but um it wasn&amp;#39;t something that I necessarily felt passionate about but I was looking for a job at one point cuz my like temp work had ended or whatever and I looked on Craigslist for just random jobs and I was like oh I could probably do data entry because that was one of the things that I&amp;#39;d done at my temp jobs so I found this data entry position in Boston and it ended up being at this small web dev shop and I got the job there started out doing data entry but then they ended up teaching me like SQL database work and doing net um programming and Microsoft Access for those of you who remember um so yeah there was that was kind of like my entrance into like the world of web development even though I had taught myself how to build websites when I was younger it was always just something I did for fun and it just never clicked in my brain that this is something that people can get a job in and also make like really good money so for some reason it just took me falling into that job and realizing like oh I have these like skills that I can develop and then use to apply for you know actual web development jobs cuz the job that I got from Craigslist was like very contract like temporary stuff yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s almost like Destiny&amp;#39;s way of like you know repeatedly like shoving you in this direction yeah um so so you&amp;#39;re starting to learn the skills how do you go about learning this giant Corpus of knowledge it sounds like you already knew a little bit about you know Microsoft access database tool that comes with Microsoft Office like the PowerPoint everybody knows how to use PowerPoint everybody knows how to use Excel and Word but not as many people know how to use access because yeah the learning curve is a little bit steeper um but it sounds like you were you were learning relevant Tech skills just on the job and you were being pushed in this more technical Direction like do you remember a clear point where somebody entrusted you with actually building something do you remember what your first project was I mean I started out and I think this is what I think people realize when you get your first job in programming or web development or whatever is that you&amp;#39;re not necessarily going to be tasked with building this entire giant project from scratch most likely you&amp;#39;re going to be given tasks to do in existing projects that the company already has had running so that&amp;#39;s what I did so I had to work on this website and I had to for example you know add or subtract um drop down menu items so I had to learn how to do that so it&amp;#39;s very like task by task based or I had to learn how to um make changes to the websites that they needed with CSS or um just like learning how to run reports and write reports and SQL to get you know data from one of their clients so it was very much like I need to do this thing because my boss told me to if I don&amp;#39;t know how to do it I need to figure it out yeah so uh essentially you had the benefit of having somebody tell you what to do and give you these missions and then each mission was like a growth opportunity uh and and how did you figure stuff out like because again you have no formal programming training you are a hobbyist like web designer I guess um and you have very rudimentary skills probably but you do have the benefit of kind of like a sense of Aesthetics you have like an eye from photography and from taking art class and stuff like that uh maybe you could talk about like the like your Ascent as far as like gaining more confidence uh in your abilities as you ran these kind of like fetch Quests for your for your boss yeah I think like looking back I honestly really lucked out with that job um it paid pretty terribly and also like I wasn&amp;#39;t paid for eight hours a day I was only paid for like the actual tasks that they could build to their clients so depending on how busy they were it I might only have like 30 minutes or like a couple hours a day but what I did learn was how to learn or how to find solutions to things um because my boss would explain one time how to do something like how to you know run a squl query and how to write it and then I would have to do the same thing for a similar task and he got very grumpy if I had to ask him how if I had to ask him to explain something to me more than once so he actually would give me um and I think there were a couple other people working there at the time we all had notebooks that we had to leave at the office and we had to take notes um so if he would explain something I would write it down how to do it and then if I had to do the same task in the future I could just refer back to my notebook and be like oh this is how to do it and then if you do that five or 10 times eventually you learn how to do it without having to refer to your notes so that process times you know a hundred or however many times I just learned everything kind of Peace Meal which was one way to learn I think it worked out for me um because you learn real skills applicable skills like right away um you know I didn&amp;#39;t learn things from a class and then have to figure out how that works in the real world later on so it was it was an interesting way to learn I&amp;#39;m not sure if that way exists as much anymore because this is back before coding boot camps existed so in some ways timing wise I really was fortunate in in terms of being able to find this job and also use my skills to land another Junior Dev job um a couple years later so I think the world has just changed a lot from that um but you know that&amp;#39;s how it was for me I mean what you describe doesn&amp;#39;t sound unlike what like a blacksmith might do to like an apprentice thousands of years ago right or maybe hundreds of years ago uh where it&amp;#39;s like I already showed you how to do this like almost kind of like a cartoon like if you ever seen the old Sam Remy Spider-Man movies The Cigar chomping boss with like the the buzz cut and he&amp;#39;s sitting back in his he&amp;#39;s like Parker I told you to do this this and this you know kind of like very um I guess uh he has very high standards for you and what you&amp;#39;re going to get done right um very much trial by fire yeah and that Trial By Fire Man the the lawnmowing is really intensifying again I apologize uh if anybody hears like you know what sounds like a helicopter landing it&amp;#39;s very faint okay good good good good uh thank you for reassuring me that uh as I&amp;#39;m very openly say like at free camp we don&amp;#39;t do anything of these podcasts like this is unfiltered like unfolding in real time right uh and for me that&amp;#39;s like exciting it&amp;#39;s exciting that there are a bunch of men with hoodies and leaf blowers outside my window like playing a part in this recording so uh yeah it sounds like you learned a ton from that opportunity even though it was probably like um it was like a certain window of time when it was like the Wild West in programming and technology and there weren&amp;#39;t there wasn&amp;#39;t really the expectation maybe that somebody would have formally studied programming and computer science or they if they studied that they probably studied a bunch of Applied Mathematics they didn&amp;#39;t study how to build websites and how to do do and a lot of this these Technologies were kind of being invented on the fly during that era um so you don&amp;#39;t necessarily have comprehensive textbooks maybe you go to like a a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble or a borders and you get
